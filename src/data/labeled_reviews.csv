(3) hopefully it goes through I set up my account and my phone number I thought everything went through and I'd get my tax return but it wasn't until months after I realized it was rejected so I had to have the irs send me the info and had to wait for them because I don't have credit and couldnt get it through email but other than that if it all works out hopefully I'll have my refund I usually take my taxes to somebody so I didn't have all the info and after a long time I realized it didn't go through|0|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0
(1) What happened??? I wondered whatever happened to my refund and finally got the information I needed to check the status. I found out both Federal and State were rejected and there was never an notification received stating this. Very poor communication Turbo Tax!! Never notified me my refund was REJECTED|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|1

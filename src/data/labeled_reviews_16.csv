3 | Some Improvement Necessary I had to wipe out my original attempt, file for an extension, and start from scratch. I got confused entering foreign income. My income was doubled and I just couldn't make my way back in the process to fix it. None of the Edit options would get me back to the duplication.



Entering Foreign Income is muddy. My original error was that I missed a Help Box explaining how to report income when you can't receive W-2's. I originally followed the options presented with my best judgement and interpretation, and got in trouble.



The direction that I actually needed to be pointed in, and the method to create Form 4852's shouldn't be buried in a linked help pop-up - that I saved as a PDF so I wouldn't get lost again. It should be clearly presented as part of the filing process.



My wife is not a US citizen. TTax saw the omission of her SSN as an error. She can't have one.



My employers are foreign. TTax demands an ID number for employers. No ID creates an unfixable error.



The above fields should accept N/A or other text.



I tried to enter my drivers license for security at the end of the process.. You can't unless you're a resident of a US State or territory. The drop-down needs an Other option. Confusing for those who live and work outside the US. | 101496555|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|4

1 | Problems, Problems, Problems I have never had so much trouble filing my taxes as I had this year. The program lost my return after it was started. No phone contact. Emailed. Days waiting for a reply. The only reply was "Start over." Started over. Saved after each step. Started the program again. No file. Emailed. Waited for reply. Answer: start over. I started for the 3rd time. Fortunately, TurboTax finally found LAST YEAR'S return and I worked NON-STOP, no breaks, no sleep until I finished and printed it. I get a refund. But no address where I am supposed to mail the return. (I DO NOT TRUST THAT TURBO TAX WILL DELIVER MY RETURN SINCE IT HAS ALREADY LOST IT TWICE!) Then it prints out estimated tax forms with no explanation of why since I'm getting a refund. I am seriously considering using another tax preparation program next year. I can't take this kind of frustration. Started return. Saved. Disappeared. No phone number to contact TurboTax. Sent message. Waited for a response...days | 101120164|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|6

3 | Didn't get the refund I expected The headlines say it all. I didn't get the refund I expected, and I've been using TurboTax since 2010. Also, the program had trouble installing on my PC due to its dependency on the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and 4.5. The disc I had would not install on anything with a newer version of that software. Difficulty installing software on Windows 10 PC | 101076821|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|8
3 | Some improvment needed. Although the program walks you through your taxes nicely, the language and explanations throughout could be clearer. Some are outright confusing.

3 |  Approaches a dreaded task in a nice cheerful tone, and the output looks good. But it does seem like after all these years as the market leader there has been little improvement year over year. The color codes for data fields are either inadequately defined or aren't always applied as defined. When reviewing completed forms there should be an easy way to find the source for a data item. I never did figure out the Tax Data tab. Help sometimes get shy when it is most needed. Help is very shy for the Calif state forms, which are unbelievably tedious and complex. Requiring the Business package to be purchased to handle a basic vacation home rental seems unkind. The easy rollover of data from year to year and fear a competitor's import function may not work well has kept me from experimenting with the competition, unfortunately.

1 | Worst product on the market for part year resident This was the most painful tax preparation I've ever had, and then an accountant tells me the other day that TurboTax is an awful product. Well, on that I agree. It was the biggest waste of $69 and 4 days of my life.

4 full days later I may have finally figured out everything in order to file.



It is the most anti intuitive software ever developed for use as a part year resident. It does not guide you through the process and only when you know what to look for with all the forms required for Foreign Earned Income and Foreign Interest and Taxes paid. Even then, you have to specifically search for a form because TT does not take you to all the correct forms for Foreign Income, etc.



I did my preliminary taxes on FreeTax USA in about 20 minutes and the only reason I went to TT was because I needed form 2555. 



I could have done my taxes by hand in hours instead of days using TT. Worst tax software for using if you worked in another country for a part year timeframe. everything | 100865912|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|15
3 | Problem with 2016 Turbotax I wasted time, this year and past years, unable to input details required. I hold stocks in five countries in addition to the USA. Eventually, I entered details in the requisite form, but that was difficult to accomplish.



Once more, I implore TurboTax to fix this problem. 



No response to past attempted contacts. Why not? My guess: TurboTax only interested in seeing gushy compliments in this on-line format. No interest in hearing directly from users about problems encountered.



I don't like this attitude at all. Someday a more responsive tax software developer will come along, and then good-bye TurboTax. Foreign Tax Credit interface inadequate | 100799726|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|16

I had to pay back $415.00.... I spend quite a bit of time explaining the turbo tax foul up to the irs... 2014 tax software had a bug.. irs flagged my taxes and i had to pay 415.00. i amended my tax. | 100706679|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|19

3 | Federal very good, States need work As reviewed before, the Federal portion of TurboTax is quite good. Interview portion is quite thorough, with informative background and only a few holes, e.g. it is difficult to figure out how the info from the TT interview boxes actually translate onto the tax forms themselves (such as when trying to compare amounts from the .pdf of last year's return with what & how I'm entering it on this year's.



The state returns (I file resident in VA and non-resident in MN) are another story. Very little in the way of background information and -- infuriatingly -- TT forces me to close out of the state return and dig back through the federal interview when it asks me to allocate income between the two states. Since it was clear from the beginning of the return that I would file multiple states, TT should include in the federal interview a way to tag income as to which state it is being earned in. That's what the extra $39.99 I'm paying you for the state return should cover. State products of markedly lower quality | 100554020|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|21

2 | Turbotax lacked my filing on time I filed my taxes on turbotax on time and waited to have my checking account debited on state and federal. The state took theirs, but the federal never debited my account. I waited an ample period of time to no avail. I finally contacted the IRS and they said I never filed. I have a printed copy from Turbotax saying the federal tax would be withdrawn 4/1/17. I filed my taxes on time and it failed to efile it | 100396767|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|23

3 | It works, but could be more helpful I have used TurboTax for over a dozen years now, and do not think I could do my taxes by myself without it. It works fine for the most part, and seems quite accurate. And Intuit stands behind their product. Well, sort of....



This year, I needed to file an extension. I had IRA contributions entered into my return. There was, in some fine print, the deadline I needed to make them by, but sadly, I should also have received a BIG WARNING dialog when I filed for an extension that they MUST be made before the initial tax deadline. (I thought you had until the extension deadline to make the contribution.) Sadly, this cost me over $1700 in additional taxes because I did not make the contributions on time. 



TurboTax, you do a great job, but when important items like this can be an issue, hit us over the head with notices or dialogs that make sure we understand issues such as important dates. The fine print was not good enough for me obviously. It misses important reminders and warnings | 100303805|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|26

3 | Turdbo Tax I used to pay $29.99 for your basic program and it worked fine for what I needed. Now you are at $59.00 and then in the middle of the program held me hostage to upgrade because I have a home business. I always was able to do that in the $29 program with no issue. Then when I was upgraded to the $114 program....it did not allow me to opt out of the option to file state taxes and you charge another $40. So I paid $154 for some thing I used to pay $29 for.

TurboTax does provide the capability for in the Home and Business version,. This should be built into the Business Version as is currently coded into the Home and Business Version.

2 |  I was pretty disappointed this year. It was very hard to find and edit things once I entered them. I was actually advised by my broker to start from the beginning. And I couldn't find phone support for TurboTax. This took way too long. I will seriously consider paying someone for 2017. Especially since I'm spending over $150 by the time I pay for TurboTax, Audit Defence, and eFile fees.

1 | I knew I would need some help While I found the tax advice staff friendly, smart and helpful, I will never use Turbo Tax again because of their hard to find phone number and the really terrible computer which thinks it is smart. It took help to find their phone number for tax advice or anything. I could not can get through the phone number computer without being hung up on, and had to call more times to get connected to a human. They first route you to someone who is not an expert and that person tries to answer your question, but can't and just waste more of your time. The computer can not understand "Southern". I was using a store bought copy of the software and the computer didn't allow for that and always wanted to look up my account which I don't have, so since they could not find an account they hung up. This happened multiple times on different numbers. When I finally got a human I would ask them for a work-around the computer and they would give me different number and tell me to say different words, but nothing worked, the different numbers connected to the same computer. Then I would have to call back and try again with different answers. I never did figure out the correct responses to get through on first try. On the computer screen there is no good overview on using the various options on the screen. Search comes up with lots of information but not what I was looking for. Turbo tax uses a bunch of forms which are not shown to do some of the calculations. When something goes wrong you can not see what is being done to know how or what form to correct. When I went to file my one and only state they charged my credit card for $24+ but on the package it was offered for $19+. It would probably cost me $100 in time to try to get my $5 back. Their phone and sales is geared to maximizing their income and decreasing their time, shifting the cost to the customer. I wasted enough time on getting the number in the first place and then getting through the computer to get the assistance who then had to transfer me to the tax advice dept who was busy and would call back later. Each time going through the computer wasted more time. With the waste of my time i can pay someone next year and it will be cheaper than using the Turbo tax software. And I will be sure to ask them so I find someone who is not using Turbo Tax or Intuit. But again, the people the corporation hires that are the tax advisors are great and useful. Just the Intuit corporation decision makers that I no longer wish to support with my dollars. Not value for the cost unless your time is worth very little and you can put up with the frustration. The helpful staff knew the computer was a problem and that it could not speak "southern" and knew a lot of people were having problems getting through the computer. The computer certainly didn't have any training on southern hospitality. Finding and getting through their computer is terrible | 99448116|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|47

Using the 2016 version has been a disappointment compared to prior years, however. Specifically, some information that I've entered in prior years (K-1's that I receive, charities to which I donate) failed to carryover into my 2016 return automatically. That created somewhat more work for me, as I had to once again enter some information that I'd already entered in prior years.



Even worse, however, I had some loss carryovers that didn't automatically carryover from my 2015 return (done with TurboTax) to 2016. I fortunately noticed this issue and was able to enter the information by looking at last year's return, but this problem simply shouldn't have happened. I don't understand the source of the problem, because when I sign into my TurboTax account I am able to see prior years' returns.



Intuit: please fix this problem so that it doesn't happen again in 2017. A lot of 2015 information didn't carryover to 2016 automatically | 99111527|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|57

1 | NO GOOD! TurboTax only offered a checklist of the type of insurance that I had. I get assistance with my premium and so of all the choices Medicaid seemed the closest choice (assumed it was a form of Medicaid). IRS says differently and apparently I should have chosen Obamacare (I thought ALL insurance plans fell under this)!! I owe even more and might loose my assistance next year cause of this!!!

2 | More difficult and expensive than it should be It works ok, but it's more difficult than it should be to go back to edit previous information you entered. In many sections, it re-asks the same questions and doesn't properly remember your previous answers. So it takes a lot of work to return to a section you had previously visited.



And charging $25 to e-file state taxes is absurd. That's just a money grab from people who are too lazy to print the few pages that make up state returns. Difficult to go back to find forms | 98542035|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|65

1 | 8962 and 1095 forms I helped my daughter fill out Turbo tax and at the end we kept getting errors. Nothing would let us continue. Your questions do not take into consideration all the tax situations. I believe your programmers need to take careful look at the Instructions for the IRS form 8962 for 2016. I am not sure how 2017 but in the meantime, you can fix a patch the issues your software has when there are situations in the allocation. She ended up getting a letter from the IRS, her refund has been delayed. And its not our fault. we ansered the questions your program asked. I have used TurboTax for decades and never had issues to my knowledge, but this one, makes me never want to use your program again.

3 | Import Nightmare I saved a lot of money doing my return myself and understood the process better. I'll never go back to an accountant to do my tax returns after what I learned. However, TurboTax software online is deceptive when asking you if you want to upgrade because they don't tell you the limitations of each version of the software and force you to learned it the hard way--in my case, losing the ability to import my bank transactions from my bank by switching to Self-Employed. That was a nightmare and multiple company representatives had no idea about the issue or how to fix it. It's a huge issue. All versions should be able to import bank transactions, period. At a minimum, you need to do a better job of explaining the pros/cons of each version before people commit to a version only to realize they A) lose certain capabilities, like importing bank transactions, and B) can't switch back. importing transactions was a nightmare | 97953266|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|86

3 | used to be better I used to like the turbo tax where you could jump to the form and fill it out without the Q/A, and you could enter a figure as "estimated". that helped to get a ballpark idea of how much you were going to need to save up, and flag areas that needed you to return with exact numbers. It's also cheesy that you can't print a pdf of your tax return until the very end (after you pay to e-file). Let people use the software, then review and mark-up a paper copy. Heaven forbid they decide to file the paper and not pay the high fees for electronic submission! More freedom!

1 | No Record of E-File The e-file needs work. My status stated pending but I did not receive an email stating my returned had not been filed. As a result I am returning the file late.

2 | E-File issues Due to unforeseen circumstances returns had to be filed at separate times causing hardship in mailing on and e-filing the other. The state returned the mailing with a bogus error because they are out of money. Same thing happens every year. You need to make the e-filing easier on the user so state can be sent without having to click-and-click till you find the right section.

3 | mixed bag My situation is unusual. I'm a Dual national, living overseas. This brings up one problem immediately. I had to actually change my address on my credit card before I could buy the damned thing.. hello? here are people OUTSIDE the USA who need to pay US taxes.. The software understands that.. (except when insisting on a USA driver's license). Why can't the website people?

On thing that bugs me is that if there is a number that you don't understand, and you click on it, it just looks at you and says "Calculated". Great, you then have to scan all possible forms to see if you can find where it go that from.

Many years ago turbotax allowed you to click on a number and it SHOWED you how it got that number. (or at least tried) Each year seems to be worse in this regard.

The online version is a joke. After a couple of days going over the same pages again and again, I gave in and bought the download version, where you can look at the actual forms to see whats' going on. hard to follow wht it's doing | 96730702|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|124
3 | Too high I start a small business last year and had a lot of expenses. Since the majority of my income (90+%) comes from Social Security, paying $114.00 to file my taxes for a company that had a gross adjusted income of $400 dollars makes this a software that I will not use again if I can find a different alternative. Too high | 96700830|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|125
3 | payment process When it came time to pay, there were no choses. I only wanted option one. But the system made me pay 139.00 for all 3 services that I did not want. I want this rectified ASAP. it did not give me a choose | 96653387|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|126
3 | Easier than last year I've used TurboTax for the past 10 years - 2014 was difficult, 2015 was a nightmare - gave it 1 last try. I will use it next year as I discovered to let TT lead you through everything, as wrong entries are difficult to delete.



I always apply any refund to next year's taxes - federal is not that hard to do, PA state is not possible. Some entries are next to impossible to correct | 96645754|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|127
3 | California State The step by step review skipped some complicated questions on this return like the number of days and percentages calculating penalties.

2 | Please stop lobbying against your customers Have recently learned of Intuit's lobbying to prevent the simplification of the tax code. Naturally, this would potentially obviate your business, but it angers me that you are preventing something that would benefit the entire country simply to keep your virtual monopoly of online tax filing.



Please stop this. Intuit lobbies to keep their business alive at my expense | 96596117|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|129
3 | Basic software The edition for small business owners lacks the ability to make expense policy election that are needed or safe harbor on building rentals. In addition I would like the software better if they had you pay all fees needed up front instead of having to get in and out when you are trying to do the state or e filing. Overall, the software is not hard to use. The addtion for Schedule C lacks federal elections that might be necessary. | 96397801|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|130
3 | Finally Done It appears TT is listening because they added back the Sched. C forms in Deluxe after getting a good reprimand from the outraged public. However, it was nearly impossible to confirm this before I purchased the CD. Nowhere on the TT website does it list which forms are on which CDs. It's all conveniently geared to make the consumer upgrade due to a lack of information. I don't appreciate the deceptive practices. Why does TT feel the need to be deceptive anyway? If you've been using this program since the MacInTax days, it's really hard to switch. I want to switch, but I'm too afraid my past information won't transfer and I'll lose out on some deductions. Don't like that I must be connected to wifi to print. Don't appreciate you pulling forms a couple years ago. | 96352093|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|131

1 | What happened to prievious year's returns? When I started my return I immediately tried to access previous years returns and was unable to do so. Searching this item, I noticed many people were also having this issue. I thought it was because I did not yet purchase this year's service but after completing the purchase am still unable to access older returns. What's up with that?

3 | Difficult To Follow I found it difficult to move from one form to another to see what I had already stated. When I started using Turbo Tax in the mid-90's, I didn't have this problem. I also had to answer some questions many times, every time I reviewed a form, such as Form 2555, Foreign Earned Income. In the past, one was able to do lists with calculations right on the form; can't do that any more. Turbo Tax lost a great deal of convenience. In sum, I am far less pleased with Turbo Tax than I was 20 years ago. Difficult to move around. Had to answer the same questions many, many times. | 95968082|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|139

1 | Not as good as it used to be I have used turbotax.com in prior years (2014 and 2015). It has all of my data for last two years.



Have a rental property. While entering the 2016 info for rental property, it was showing 2015 info in a column. I made some errors and wanted to start over. So I went back and deleted the 2016 entry for rental property. Now when I started over, all the 2015 info of rental property gone.



This is serious flaw, as software should still be able to retrieve 2015 info.  | 95629007|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|141
3 | Good, but some improvement still needed While Form 1116 can be challenging to anyone, it is far easier to manually use the form then to use TurboTax to complete it. While this form may not be used by a majority of filers, there are enough that use it to justify improving the TurboTax product handling of the form at some point (this has been a problem for years). From the perspective of a user, this aspect of TurboTax is seriously flawed, and the Help information on the topic does not come close to compensating for the deficiency. Handling of Form 1116 entries from multiple sources is very confusing, if not incomprehensible. | 95402324|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|142

1 | Stay Away from Turbo Tax!!! I will do everything I can to warn others about the fraudulent business practices of Turbo Tax. They caused me so much headache last year I am the fool for returning.

2 | Service gone down The functionality of TT is mostly the same; however, your e-filing functionality and support have become horrible.

2 | much more difficult this time I thought I had e-filed, but when I checked back the system said no. I had double and triple checked, and it took four tries before the efile when through... a MONTH after the tax deadline. I don't think I want to use Turbo Tax again. I have never had this happen before and I am really distressed about this. I have used Turbo for years. Not any more.

3 | Good software with some quirks The best feature by far is that it downloads info from previous years' returns on your computer and computes things like depreciation and amortization automatically. But the software is not trivial to use. Even download instructions could be better. You are prompted to move the disc image to application folder, which only introduces more aliases of the same disc in Applications. It turns out you have to move the red check icon in the prompt itself to the Application icon. 

A bug: My 2015 returns got saved as 2016 taxes. This could create problems if I didn't rename. 

Still unsure how to treat passive book royalties (or other 1099-MISC), which are personal income, not business. The software insists on treating this income as business. This time I just entered them as personal income from "property I own". On schedule E, the amounts appear on line 4, but they are not added on lines 23b or 24. In the past years, if I entered them in business part as "royalties" and added specifics on the list of 1099-MISC forms, the amounts were doubled on my returns. So I still don't know what to do with these forms. Fortunately, in my case, the amounts are small.

On the state interview the questions about property taxes have always been very confusing. Finally, this year (TurboTax 2016 Home and Business) it was pretty obvious that the question was about my personal part of property taxes, not all property taxes I paid. I think I lost some money in the past by misunderstanding the questions. 

Otherwise, if you have income properties that produce rent, the software is very helpful and reasonably easy to use. It gets somewhat more complicated if you live in one of these properties. Also, editing data may introduce problems, so if you have to change anything, I would recommend starting from scratch. Some bugs and unclear instructions | 95069189|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|156
2 | Automatizing lots of things but... Turbotax does not provide helpful advice while filing for new residents: you need to spend your time reading FAQs (sometimes contradictory) to try to understand what to do from what others have done.

Also contradictory to what is mentioned, you cannot e-file your state return if you're mailing your federal return. And you cannot e-file your federal return if you're a new resident and as you or your dependents do not have an SSN or an ITIN (which you can only get while filing for the first time).

1 | Oh No! I have been using TurboTax for many years and usually like the ease and simplicity of it. Not this year. Besides struggling over the instructions to handle my marketplace insurance, there was a little problem in transmitting my file. After reviewing my return and going through the process of e-filing it (on time!), one month later, I determined it was NEVER SENT. I know I hit the "send" button. Nothing was filed. One hour on hold with the IRS later, I was informed that I might be penalized for filing late .... no thanks to TurboTax. Marketplace insurance instructions ... very confusing! Return never tranmitted after I selected the e-file option. | 94921533|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|160

3 | We're getting closer... TurboTax is pretty straightforward. You'll probably only spend a couple hours getting things right if you have a semi-complicated return with form 8454 or 8459, royalties, a couple K-1s etc. It doesn't handle certain things as well as you'd hope.



My biggest complaint is that the price is one thing before April 15th. If you sign up then, but file an extension, ti's something different come May 15th when all the K-1s have arrived. If I weren't so fed up with everything I'd complain about it.



It'll save you if you have motivation to figure out what you should be doing vs shoving a box of shyte into an accountants lap.

1 | What your paying for... TurboTax has always been my choice of Tax preparation programs, until this year when I encountered an issue with the IRS and my return was not allowed to be efiled. Turbotax was not able to help me and they still charged me the $154 to basically help me fill out the forms. In short make sure that you know you are paying for TT to help you fill out the forms. Not for efiling because if for some reason you encounter problems where your return is rejected from the IRS you will still have to pay TT and then go and mail your return. To me this is not worth the amount of money I was charged this year. Switching to another program next year.

1 | Charged me twice This is all fact, no emotion. I purchased a copy of Turbo Tax at Costco paying $49.99 for the program. The $49.99 was to pay for federal tax preparation, e-filing and one state tax filing. At the end of the program YOU would not allow me to submit my account until I paid you an extra $34.99. This is why my taxes were not filed on time, see previous entry. To use Turbo Tax Premier it cost me $84.98 plus the $50 late fee from the IRS.

- Customer support "callback" feature only handles US numbers (which makes it very difficult to get help).

- Payment options are limited to US credit cards with US billing addresses, and even then do not always work.

- Software does not handle some situations (i.e. a spouse without a social security number).



The software can help with the complications of living overseas, but it is still painful to use...  | 94352931|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|183
3 | locked in to a rising cost Ive been filing with turbo tax for a few years but part of that is because they have all my past information and they hold it hostage. So I have to pay the to pull it up otherwise I have to go through a rigamarole to get my past returns. I like turbo tax but this year it was almost $100 to file and have it depisited in my account.

3 | navigating Turbotax Total absence of support in the last days for filing from Intuit. The crowd help desk concept is cheap and does not lead to a good customer experience.

1 |  Nice screens if you are 100% perfect. But don't expect to be able to change any errors. Before you pay, you can't see what you have done. After you pay, you can't change it. 

 This applies especially to the state returns, which as far as I can see, are prepared at a much lower level.

 Customer service tries very, very hard. But if the problem is too complex, they seem to be unable to help. Can't print return until it is filed. | 94016347|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|189

3 | Tougher than it has to be Turbo Tax does the job, but one has to watch carefully what it's doing. The biggest gripe that I have is with depreciation. My asset list comprised of 137 items. In the NJ module I noticed a discrepancy even though I had verified line by line my own depreciation calculations with the ones of Turbo Tax. It turned out that 3 items from the federal return were not carried over to the NJ return even though they had a depreciation amount greater than zero. What I was also missing is no advice when the lowly NJ S179 threshold total was exceeded. It only advised when an individual item exceeded said limit. Then one had to make corrections in many asset entry worksheets. All in all, a tedious process that should not have to be like this. I wished there was a table where one could do the edits rather than the individual asset entry worksheets. Calculation error on NJ return | 93671193|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|197

2 | Review You can file for free if you have a simple tax filing, such as a 1040EZ. However, if you start with one of the tax filing packages that cost money, and you find that you can only take the standard deduction because all your deductions add up to less than the standard deduction, it won't tell you that. They will still charge you. It is better to cancel your filing and establish a new account and select the free filing at the very beginning.

2 | Deceptive As one prepares to e-file, you are bombarded with options for e-filing, etc., each of which with their own extra charges. These are woven in with the numerous in stream advertisements for additional for fee services. As a result, I mistook my state filing fee for an advertisement for additional services, and omitted.

2 |  After using Turbo tax for about 10 years, I will not use it next year. I think you are price gouging when asking $24.99 to electronically file a second state (HI) tax return. I think the $45 paid for the second state is more than enough. I notice that the premier version explains there will be a charge for a second state, but it says nothing about the additional charge for the e-file.

2 | First time I've been dissatisfied After using TurboTax for the last 20 years, for the first time e-File did not work and TT's solution was to blame it on the IRS! That's not much of an answer or excuse. Purportedly, our last year's AGC doesn't match the amount the IRS has on file. Since we used TT last year and that data was imported directly from there, that seems unlikely. Compounded with the IRS now requiring either a phone number that accepts text messages or else there is a 5-10 day wait for a postal mail, there is no way for us to check the AGC that they have on file. We already paid to e-File our state tax and must now mail our return. E-File Did Not Work | 93113219|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|208
1 | Disappointed! We have purchased Turbo Tax and Audit Defense for many years. We pay a pretty good price for Home&Business and Audit Protection. In return, we expect expect knowledge and expertise. Virtually NOBODY in product support knows anything about I-Bonds. In fact, one representative stated Turbo Tax has known of product problems since 2013 and laughed when I offered to file an extension until corrected. His supervisor was to call me because he buys I-Bonds - but he did not (nor did another)! The EA's in Tax Assistance read the IRA rules which I believe to be contradictory, and one thanked my for education. They helped me file out the Form 8888 which later required an additional 4 hours of my time and another call before my federal taxes could be filed. Please point to my ADDED VALUE AS A CUSTOMER!!! Oh, they did offer to refund 10% of product cost. It appears a superior product is now racing to the bottom. TT just keep competing for the lower level of service that pay $0 for your product. Again, I am very disappointed in what was a superior product. Next year my decision of tax software will include researching other products. Very disappointed in support this year, and specifically the lack of knowledge and follow-through on purchasing I-Bonds | 93112732|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|209
1 | 2016 Fed Tax The problem with sending was related to TurboTax sales override of the closing process. I clicked continuted and believed that the process was completed. However, I was redirected to an intuit sales site and thought the final steps were completed. I had entered all of the information needed including pin, bank, and credit card information. etc. Today's work, including having to do a close alt delete, was because of the same problem that I encountered on March 18th. However on the second try, I was able to bypass the intuit sales site after realizing that it was trying to do the same thing. I found out on 4.19.2017, that the return/payment was not sent.

When I finally finished, because I couldn't fix those forms, I had to mail in my tax returns! Yet they still charged me the $30 to file my state. This I do not understand because I was suppose to be able to file free. Definitely disappointed with how complicated this became because of the 370 form. I switched from H&R Block because my W2 auto-populated in from my former employers site but I would have rather entered in all my information to avoid the headaches of filing with this service.

3 | Refund got rejected Love the product in general, however when I tried to file as 'Married but Filing Separately', it didn't allow me to at first. Then it recommended that I file itemized instead of standard. This caused my tax return to get rejected since my spouse filed MbFS but standard. Spouses filing separately both need to file the same way, either both itemized or both standard. TurboTax should have done a check or asked about that. It would have been the difference in me getting money back federally instead of having to pay money. Doesn't catch everything | 93026374|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|224
3 | Primary Tax Payer Format When entering taxpayer names, I inadvertently placed my name before my husband's name as the main taxpayer recognized by IRS. I submitted our tax returns three times (once in March 2017 and two times after tax due date) when I realized the error. After the agonizing process of trying to figure out just what the heck happened, I finally understood. Thus, I have a suggestion for improvement: this type of error could be averted by displaying the primary tax name holder first before the secondary tax payer name, with a warning that the return will be rejected if not done properly. The anguish of such an error is unnecessarily depressing. Thanks!  | 92993723|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|225

I had a chat with a nice service lady, who said it was best to start all over! I resisted, spent over an hour on the phone and had to download the software to do this. How annoying. The desktop software was not even optimized for the high resolution laptops so the text was super tiny. In the end non of this worked. I tried calling back but could not get past the automated system. Really? Had a case number and everything. On top of that I had already paid, but once I downloaded I had to get fees waived for the two states. I didn't have the energy for all of this in the end.

I called the IRS and it turns out they have nothing on file! The TurboTax never sent it electronically when it was supposed to. So I try to send it now and it won't do it. Says it needs some updates. If this is what happened originally it is BS. When starting the TurboTax program the first thing I do is download any updates. At any rate I downloaded the "updates" and it was sent I hope.

3 |  It was my first submission with Turbo Tax. Overal impression: steps were more detailed while informative and user friendly. However, 

- I was charged the price of state e-files although this wasn't the option I selected. I have tried several times, back and forth. Turbo Tax appeared to set the e-filing of my state tax as the default even though I had opted out. 

- Total pricing was 40% higher than H&R for both federal and state e-files (with a promo code applied). I decided to go with Turbo Tax because there were certain key capabilities in H&R that I found that they had been disabled this year. 

Probably I would explore other software next year.  | 92898050|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|242

There has to be a better way of providing a service to customers without trying to eat away at their return or cause them to pay even more during tax time. They bait you in with the promise of free or minimal follow-on costs only to hold your returns hostage with upcharges. | 92894662|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|245

1 | No notice of rejected return Turbo Tax stated that an email was sent SIX weeks after I filed... When I filed, all my returns were accepted. No I might be late. You have my phone number, might this be worth a call????

1 | Electronic filing didn't work This is the first year TurboTax Business didn't work. It didn't fully figure out what forms I needed. It didn't remember what I paid for TurboTax last year (and never does) ... it didn't remember things from my tax return last year that it made me search for my last return and manually look up-- even though it has it-- and most importantly it wouldn't file my taxes electronically, and even a couple weeks later there is still no update that solves it.



It transmitted my return, but the fed kept rejecting it with an XML validation error regarding an xpath.



That's the kind of thing that should be caught right away by Intuit, and they should be on it immediately and get an update.



I still have not seen an update since tax filing day. When it failed I had a hard time talking to anyone to resolve the issue... there should be a hotline button...as in OMG your return was rejected, lets get on this NOW!



Also, I have a mac and I am sick of running a VM to run TurboTax business. Maybe time to make this a web product?



First year TurboTax failed... I ended killing a tree, and mailing my return. Hopefully it's not too messed up.



I was not the only person that had this problem either. The community advice was to print and mail the return.



Maybe the community advice should be: Dump TurboTax. The whole point is ease of use, and a HUGE part of that is electronic filing. You may not file your taxes on time | 92829989|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|248
1 | As Usual Incomplete Info Every time that I use TurboTax, there is incomplete info which causes me to have to deal with the IRS. Based on my info, the correct form to file was a 1040A and form 8962 should have been filed with it. Instead TurboTax filed 1040EZ and no Form 8962. Now I can't access the screen that would allow me to file Form 8962. As usual, a big letdown by TurboTax. There must be a better way.

3 | finally done For dependent input, if i had to revise or correct one dependent's information (or delete one from a deduction), it would not stay or it would change a different dependent that i was not even changing or had highlighted.

2 | Poor for state returns When I got to filing my Virginia state tax, Turbotax does not let me enter the substraction for income from US government bonds - it's an explicit line item (#4) on the schedule of adjustments. Very basic; should at the very least allow me to enter data free form.

And does not let me file state only - very strange. Virginia is due 15 days after federal so a lot of people file in two stages.

And does not know or apply reciprocity agreements between VA, MD, and DC.

Conclusion: not worth the $ for state filing. Next year, I'll do a paper filing. Does not know basic state tax for Virginia | 92662643|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|251
2 | Still screws up deduction for state sales tax Printing is a pain, I want to control which pages I print and which pages I skip Turbotax makes that difficult.

3 | Still screws up deduction for state sales tax Except for the problem for folks who live in a state with a state sales tax but no state income tax it is a good program.

2 | concerned review As a first time filer, i made some mistakes. I was able to pinpoint where my mistake was, however i COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME figure out how to get to the exact spot to fix it and i COULD NOT get a human on the phone to help me resolve this issue. I cannot express how frustrating it was to have to file a question online and wait for "community posters" to answer. The posts were insightful, but not helpful. I was not able to have my unique situation resolved by the generic posts. So for that i would absolutely figure this out turbo tax, its unacceptable to not get connected with a human.

On screen Turbo Tax indicated that my Federal tax returned had been e-filed. Since I have never had a problem in prior years I didn't pay attention to may tax returns anymore. I noticed on 4/29 that the federal government had not yet debited my bank account so I went back into Turbo Tax and saw that it was back to the section asking if I wanted to e-file the federal return.

1 | You failed in orignial efile process I used turbo tax and completed everything and asked for my payments to be deducted from my checking account. When I went to balance my checking account I found that the amounts had not been deducted. When I opened turbo tax it stated that my returns had not been efiled even though I had previous received notice that they had been. Now I am late filing will probably have to pay a penalty.

2 | First turbo The input of data especially for foreign tax credit was exhausting!The volume of input data printed was also was very long and tiring.You should make clear that you are not open to receive credit card charges for e-filing on the week-end especially when the filing date is on a Monday and the likelihood of getting confirmation that an e-filing has been achieved by the end of the day is remote to nil especially when you are in the Eastern time zone. too much detail on K-1 input, same for info on form 1116 .It was a res pain to discover that I could not pay the state | 92359104|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|262
3 | Thought previous years were better. Overall the Fed and State tax input process was ok (not good or great). I feel that previous years (been using TT for over 15 years) was better and easier to find info and help on certain sections.



I did NOT like the printing aspect when preparing to file the state return. I wanted to file by mail and save the $24.99 e-file fee. That part was poorly done. I could not figure out what Federal tax forms I had to file with the State return. They should have programmed it to LIST and enable printing the state form and just the required federal forms.



It felt like TT wanted to have it confusing to squeeze the efile fee out of me - which I ended up doing. :(



I may have to find another alternative to TT for next year. Printing state return w/reqd Fed forms poor. | 92164612|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|263

2 | 11th year of loyalty; this year, no support I've been a Turbo Tax user for 11 years, never with one issue. This year, I see changes in the program for which I cannot find support. For one, I cannot edit the amount of Real Estate tax I entered, which is causing our return to be grossly incorrect. One of our sons joined the military after college, and am not sure how to deal with that change. I have spent days trying to find ways to edit, even creating a new return, to correct the issues and nothing is successful. Our returns are still rejected. If I could just talk to someone, I could fix and submit the returns. No support this year to help with 3 critical issues | 91878253|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|266

Never received any email so I checked the following week using the button in the email. Sure enough it was rejected and now I am on a business trip and can't fix it for a week! Not what I expected and certainly hope that there won't be any penalties. I did mail the check on time so hopefully it is all set.

1 | Rediculous hidden pricing! I purposely purchased the Deluxe edition that included 5 Free Federal filings and 1 State. When I got to through everything, I ended at finally e-filing and there was a hidden up charge to Premium to be able to take my state filing fee out of my return. So I purchased the product, paid the fee and THEN had an up charge for the courtesy of taking my fee? Preposterous!!!!! Next year, I'll be using another product. As well as, last year I filed 2 returns on the online product, it should have notified me that one would overwrite the other using the same logon. Every time I use it there is hidden pricing when it comes to online filing. | 91795895|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|274
3 | Disappointing I find it very frustrating that I cannot get in contact with a TurboTax representative to discuss my return and why it has not arrived, although filed correctly with notification that I successfully completed my return. The fact that I need to go through multiple avenues to reach an IRS representative, which sometimes does not provide solutions is even worse.

1 | streamline your product I filed the last two years by logging on to your online service. I realized I could save some money this year by using the software CD. Despite the fact that I am the same person with all the same information, the product I am using still connects through the web, I am not recognized through YOUR OWN PRODUCT as a continued user. I could not use last years info from your own database to file my taxes this year. This lead me to have an error which caused my taxes to be rejected (my wifes AGI, which I got after logging into turbotax , was wrong). Considering taxes are a very serious thing I would have expected more than just an email letting me know that my file had been rejected. While filing my taxes I give a lot more information than just email. This all would have been much more forgivable if the emails offered me any sort of recourse or at least more information. My whole family has been using turbotax for several years, but that more than likely has come to an end. no support, hidden fees, if i use software it doesnt recognize me as a continued user | 91793298|1|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|277
2 | Big problems in 2016 After days of work in March, my return disappeared when I returned to it in April. I have used TTax for many years and am very familiar with how to save a file. This required many hours to en-enter and file after 4/17/17. I had also entered Audit Defense payment information in the original prep, and am unsure whether I have it or not after the file disappeared. Disappointing!

2 | Let Down and Disappointed I have used Turbotax for at least 15 years. In all that time the 2016 software was the first to let me down. I am also disappointed in your customer service. My form was rejected due to an inconsistency between my 2015 and 2016 AGI. The amount on line 37 of the 2015 return is identical to the amount reported on the 2016 return. I tried to reach customer service and got an automated phone menu which refused to transfer me to a live person. I wrote you in an email and posted my comments on your community forum. No response has been forthcoming. I then spent two hours waiting on the IRS help line. Of course their response was that they can't share that information with me. So I ordered my 2015 transcript and hopefully that will shine some light on the issue. My brother is a professional tax expert. He warned me that your 2016 product has multiple failures. Sadly, I should have let him prepare my taxes as he suggested. Finally, when I tried to sign in, your system did not recognize me even though I have used your product for at least 15 years.

I tried several things; the thing that worked was a ghost drive. I copied the disk which I was surprised how easy it was. I was able to forced the program to load without checking for the update at all. at first it was very unstable but I used a few tools and got it to run. I have used turbo tax for many years they should just keep it simple and stop worrying about pretty pictures and videos of that people don't use. and don't want. 90% of this disk could have been cut out and no one would have noticed.

2 | First time I've ever had a complaint... Went to file federal at about 11pm the 18th (yes I know it was at the deadline) Program asked for some additional info - presented me with some mostly blank 1099s for my wife's business. I was able to fill out 2 or three that had some info that allowed me to identify where it came from. The 4th one was completely blank!!! What was I supposed to do? Finally gave up at about 1:30pm. Went back the next morning and mistakenly saw something that made me think it had been filed. Waited until today the 26th expecting a receipt notice. Saw just now that the returns HAD NOT BEEN filed so I am 8 days late. Yes, I know this is my fault; should have called you as soon as it happened. The way I got it to file today was to make the blank 1099 look like it was mine and then the program accepted it filed the return. Next year: get done sooner than the last day and call you if a problem crops up. You might want to try to find out why it wanted extra info at the last moment and why the 1099 form was blank.

2 | disappointing this is the second year I have used turbotax. I have all the forms and everything printed from the first year and my old info was automatically filled in for this year which was very helpful. When I got to the end of the filing process I learned that somehow my taxes did not get e-filed even though I paid for the state filing and finished everything including my account info for how to pay my remaining tax due. I am 100% positive that i clicked through every possible screen last year and hit submit or file or whatever it is you push to finish the process but they were not filed. This has been a huge time burden for me to figure out why the IRS has no record of my taxes last season and I am worried about having to pay a fine. Be on the lookout for emails from turbo tax that your taxes have actually been filed and if not, keep checking in on the status.  | 91378374|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|294
1 | SUMMARIZE CAPITAL GAINS/LOSSES I had over 2-300 entries that could only be entered individually. The system would not even take the individual entries correctly. In the end, I had to file by mail because your TurboTax system would not accept the entries I made - this is after about 6 hours of trying to get the system to function. 

You badly need an alternative system that allows the tax payer to make summary entries.

The Gains/Losses data download from TD Ameritrade is always inaccurate when the 1099 "Undetermined" category is added. Mortgage backed bonds pay principal payments monthly. There is no cost basis shown. Nor is there a purchase date for these bonds.

1 | Not what it use to be 50.00 to file MY taxes? It use to be free. Then I made the mistake of buying a house and suddenly its cheaper to go to H&R block? Seriously, nothing else has changed. I don't own stocks or bonds. No funky history or rental property. I shouldn't be paying you 50.00 for me to file my own taxes. This is ridiculous. Its gotten EXPENSIVE | 91317019|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|299
3 | Not impressed Considering there are sites like creditkarma.com, who offer free filing, it would be nice if TT would give discounts to customers who have used their products for 5years+. When I wanted to edit a previous year's return, it said it wasn't compatible with my computer anymore! But I've already paid for it!! That part sucks. I like having all my taxes stored on one site, which is one of the reasons I continually return to TT, But that setback may cost you a customer. TOO EXPENSIVE | 91316672|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|300
3 | Works, but frustrates On the whole, it works, and is presumably accurate. However, I had an error that took longer to fix than all the rest of the data input. Foreign tax paid on shares of a Canadian company for which I received a K-1, could not be claimed as a tax credit because TurboTax couldn't link some data correctly from the K-1 to the IRS form. I had to change from a tax credit to a tax deduction to get rid of the error, after trying for over 3 hours to force TurboTax to accept the tax credit option.



Also, I have just submitted my state tax return for the third time. I hope this version gets accepted! The problem is claimed to be a failure of electronically signing. I suspect that this comes about because TurboTax asks for the previous year's adjusted gross income separately for each spouse for a joint return, even though the state wants only a single figure. If my guess is correct, this is a failure of TurboTax's state "easy step", and the amount ought to have been transferred from the previous year without requiring my input. Very frustrating to figure out where some data goes | 91316404|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|301

1 | Schedule K-1 deletion Last year's return had a schedule K-1 (form 1065). This year I no longer have this form. I deleted it but it kept on coming back at the final check stage. Searched Turbotax help, talked to 2 advisors, restarted taxes from scratch... NO help. All advice was to just file as is. Finally googled the issue and the fix was to type *anything* to name the form in the final check stage and then I could go back and delete it. What an INSANE workaround to a clear bug in your code. I spent hours and even upgraded to Self-employed even though I did not need to. all advice was incorrect | 91315899|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|303

I did not e-file and believe I should be refunded $24.99 charged to my credit card on 3/30/17. No help as promised on internet. | 91312065|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|306

3 | Not as easy as TT personal This review is for Turbo Tax Business.

2 | Big drop in usability Big, BIG disappointment on this year's product!

1 | Review of turbo Tax Turbo Tax is almost an exercise in futility. If you have any computer sense or prior use of tax software, avoid this program. 

1. Starting: this program is slow to start, even with a quad core i7 processor. It ALWAYS has some sort of delay to start. It routinely has to check back to the mothership for an update, and the downloads and updates take painfully long. Can't you get this right the first time? 

2. Menus: minimal and confusing, they insist that you follow. Very difficult to navigate to different forms. 

3. Pop ups all the time! All featuring features that the user already said that they didn't want. Spare me! I said no!

3. Some of us with prior tax knowledge have no need for the steps by step approach. Turbo Tax is most certainly Tax for Dummies. 

There's more, but if you are reading this after buying the program you already know all this and deserve it. 

I made a mistake buying this program, next year I WILL go back to H&R Block. 

Truth in reporting: I am a retired CPA and now do taxes just for myself and friends.

2 | first extension ever I had to get extension due to too many changes, and too difficult to find what info was asked for. Didn't get sufficient help thru phone support. On phone 2 hrs, nothing accomplished.

2 | I am very upset I just found out that my e file did not go through. I became worried because the money to pay my taxes was not removed from my account. Now the deadline is over and I had my taxes done three weeks ago but it was not sent. Now I am worried about a penalty from IRS. Thanks to turbotax. It needed to be clear instead of showering me with the info about having auditing for a fee. Now I see why you people are eager to sell this.

3 | No way to contact; when help advises to contact Overall the program is ok and helps with your needs.

However in the end, if you owe and charge to your CC there is a problem if you have to make a change.



Turbo Tax help "tells" you it can not transmit returns because they have to "reset" your CC Authorization.



However there is NO info on how to contact Turbo Tax to do so; A DEAD END!  | 91297376|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|313
3 | Mmmmm I really liked Turbo Tax when I first started using it about 8 years ago, but now I'm thinking about switching to another service next year. There is no incentive to stay with TT as there is no discount for long term users and I do all the work. Every year I get more and more annoyed at the amount of work and time spent doing my taxes. Too expensive, price goes up every year and always adding costs for things like paying with tax refund | 91281618|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|314

1 | Poor customer service If you need to contact Turbo Tax, you're in trouble. My return was rejected several times, but even though Turbo Tax claims they're available to help 24/7, we could not get any online, live or phone help with this problem. We will have to file our returns by mail, and late, even though we paid for efile. We are very disappointed.  | 91276688|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|316
2 | Finally Got it Done Didn't like the fact that although I had a W-2 showing my military duty (over 30 years of service), I was denied the military discount.

2 | Should be ashamed Every year it's the same thing. Claims to be free, but costs $49.99. Oh wait, State taxes? Add another $40. Oh, want to pay with your refund? Even though this doesn't cost anyone anything, how about another $40. 



I get that you guys have to make money. Just don't lie. Just come right out with it. I would feel better if you guys just said, "From $49.99-$149.99 (depending if you have state taxes), we will help you do your taxes in a simple, reliable manner". That's it. That's all you have to say. That extra little fee for paying with your return is especially snakey. It's just tacked on the end there, trying to look as inconspicuous as possible. It's the equivalent of the "email fee" that ticketmaster charged me for having my concert tickets emailed to me. Shame! expensive and tricky fees | 91260375|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|321
1 | TurboTax 16 CD First I thought I had a faulty disc so I exchanged it. The second one did the same thing. I have 2 printers. I had both of them checked by 2 computer geeks (for a lot of money). It is not the printer's fault. Both of them print anything else I want. They printed all the tax forms but only showed little rectangle boxes where my entries should have been.

1 | I did not like this filing experience I had six years of great experience while using TT, receiving refunds. This year, we expectedly owed. On 4/16/17, I scheduled a 4/18/2017 tax payment to be withdrawn from my checking acct. The completed tax forms showed the correct scheduled date, routing #/account #. In the end, software tried to force me into purchasing Audit Defense. I didn't want Audit Defense. "Final Steps" said "Thank you for using Turbo Tax", and "Way to go, It looks like your done with your taxes!"...without an emailed acknowledgment like the ones we've received in the past. I uncomfortably assumed the reason for the email absence was due to so many filings on 4/18/17. As of 4/22/17, I've rec'd no email response. Today, IRS adv they have not rec'd my filing, and told me to wait until Tuesday. I'll update my review when I recv addl info. This is not looking good. Rec'd no email acknowledgment.

1 | Terrible Exp-will cost me $$$$ This is the first time I used the web version rather than purchasing a disk. My account has not changed and I have been using TurboTax for several years. The 2015 AGI, which TurboTax added from last year, was wrong. I have no idea why or how that number is wrong. However, due to major surgery, I did not see the email showing the rejection until 3 days past tax day. The checks for what I owed had already been mailed; therefore, even if I print-out the filings for state and federal it is (1) Late and (2) Check is arriving in a different envelope.

I am on disability and now I am going to get hit with late fees and penalties which I cannot afford. Next year I will use a real-live person and never depend on TurboTax, or any Intuit product again. Turbo Tax made an error that will now cost me money! | 91040476|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|341

This year, 2016, the forms were visible as in past years, but would not print. I had to resort to 1040 Forms, complete each form with name, address, SSN's, amounts, and then print them.

2 | FRUSTRATED!!!!! When I completed my taxes on the 18th and went to efile, I discovered my email had expired. After an exhausting hunt, I finally found a form to get it changed. I had it changed to my partner's work address. However, his work address had a clutter file that locked out access. So the next day, I could not access the 6 digit code sent to me. So I put in another change of email form to a personal email account. The system said it took one business day. After waiting for a whole day, the email had not been changed, I somehow (my some miracle found an 800 number and spoke to a Jeremy.) Jeremy thought I wanted to change my passcode on the sign in. I couldn't get him to understand that I needed help getting the email changed so I could get a 6 digit code to file my taxes. Finally, he understood after being on the phone for 30 minutes and he said he would have to send me an electronic form to change the email since it had never changed the 2nd time. He didn't send the form or at least I never received it. He sent it to the old email and the new one that I was requesting to change. So today around 1:30 I got the email for for the new email change once again. I filled it out and I got back an email at the new email address saying it would be changed. So this evening I signed in and the old email (which was the first change) was still there. I sent through another email password change and pleaded with whomever was on the other side to make this happen. Within 15 minutes I received an email that said click on this link and change your password for the sign in into Turbo Tax???!!! What? change the sign in? So I complied and changed my sign in. Then I once again opened step three up to efile and it said it would send me a 6 digit code to the email listed! YEAH!!! I checked my gmail account and there it was! I was finally able to efile my taxes 3 days later!

In the mean time, TurboTax had charged me for processing even though it wouldn't let me file!

I understand and greatly appreciate security. However, I don't appreciate the fact that I had to hunt at great length for forms to change and phone numbers to speak to individuals who could not resolve my problem. I and my partner have been using turbotax since its inception and up until this year, have never had such a difficult time filing. 



I admit that I should have filed earlier and that I should have kept an up-to-date email; however, I believe I did not get the support that was needed to get the issues resolved in a timely manner - thus the serious disappointment. I respect security, but I could NOT get any support when trying to change my email so that I could get a 6 digit code | 91038505|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|343

3 | Frustrating and Complicated I was excited to have the TurboTax Premier. I had less forms, income sources, etc. than I have had in many previous years, so I thought this would be simple given it took care of stocks. 



Nope. It started easy, but when double-checking on actual IRS forms, confusing and I still had to read all the detailed info. 



Glitches: continually stated that I did not fill out my health insurance info, and every time I went to check, it was already filled out.



I had to update the software in order to get the forms for 2016 - If we pay $80 for software for 1 year's tax return, we shouldn't have to update!



It said I was filing early and I actually filed late for the first time in my life (I've been doing my own taxes for about 14 years), in part due to the confusion about the update I did not know I had to do in order to get the forms necessary to file. 



I also think this should include 1 free e-file of the state tax. Ridiculous. 



I also filled out worksheets I ended up deleting and thought I had to fill out worksheets I didn't need to because of the grey oval buttons on the forms. 



Overall, I was very frustrated. One pro- I didn't have to calculate all my taxes on paper. Required update for 2016; wrong date; consistently stated error- wasn't there; confusing form buttons; repetitive bugs | 91034559|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|346

1 | BAIT & SWITCH-WITH HUGE LOCK-INS I will NEVER, NEVER use Turbo Tax again. You insisted I had to spend $99 to file a Schedule F this year, as self-employed, instead of a 1040 long, when I refused, you added the blanks from last year, and I could not opt out of it--even though there's no tax advantage for me this year. So you wanted to supercharge me for something you were going to do anyway. WRONG! WRONG! So you play a bait and switch game with your packages. You used to check employer EINs--no more. One extra zero caused my files to be rejected. You make it look like you can get an e-refund direct deposit, but only the fine print says, "oh yeh, not with our system, if you want your fees deducted from your refund....Another bait and switch.

3 | Close but no cigar "property": real estate or possessions? seems to be both, but you need to distinguish.

trading in a used car for a new one: the trade-in value discounted from the price of the new car was considered a "capital gain"!

inability to check entries against their impact on the return form; when reviewing previous pages having to re-enter previous entries; inability to search directly for previous entries; seeing income entries for 1099s as 0 until the deductions were entered was irritating and unexplained--these were unnecessary hassles.

I had to complete three forms before I got one that made sense; once is enough, please. language sometimes unclear | 90996068|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|350

1 | Horrible!!!!!!!Don't waste your time Don't waste your money and precious time. This is worthless!!!!



My college daughter (dependent) was confused, so she filed for herself, got a refund, and did not tell me. When IRS rejected, they said one of my kids claimed themselves. I called her. She confirmed she claimed herself.

So Turbo Tax "walked me through" fixing it, I have submitted 3 times & keeps being rejected WITH THE SAME EXPLANATION, ALTHOUGH I ALREADY REMOVED THAT DAUGHTER. I AM SO FRUSTRATED!!!!!

NOT WORTH THIS!!! I keep submitting, the IRS keeps rejecting, even though I removed the error! | 90993146|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|353
3 | Not there yet I have been using TurboTax for more than ten years. Early on it was the "best in class" and then familiarity and inertia made it a "standard". But I still grumble every time I have to use it and more so lately as some issues are worsening. 

Here are my major problems with Turbo Tax:



1. Questioning interface is tedious and inefficient. It needs more thought. Program often asks questions or has entries when it should already know the answer.

2. More and more it is a sales platform for upgrading. Will stop using if this tend is not reversed. I am paying for a piece of software not a highway billboard.

3. Found several instances where it was not familiar with my State tax code. It didn't understand that sometimes you can itemize on your state return even if you don't on your Fed return.

4. If you get everything ready and work through the program in one shot things can go very smoothly but if you have to make revisions or explore "what if" scenarios then getting to where you need to be in the program can sometimes be a problem especially if the changes are at the state level where the documentation and functional segmentation is weak. Don't see a capability for setting bookmarks.

5. If you have to pay an additional fee to efile your state return then you should be informed up front what and how many pages of the return need to be printed and mailed and not at the last minute. At some point, needing to mail pieces of the return is no longer efiling.

6. Maybe tighter integration with scanning/OCR capability would help with record keeping. 

7. At any given point in the program one should be able to open a mini-spreadsheet capability that would allow notes, calculations, speculation and record keeping. Some of this is already there but several times I found myself in spots where i could not add supporting info and had to use other software. Interface design needs more thought | 90992708|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|354
2 | Impossible to Make Corrections I have no idea how many times I took my ex-wife's information out of my state tax return and your stupid, worthless software couldn't get it. 

It didn't do much better with my corrected AGI. I don't know how you manage to do that but as far as I'm concern that glitch is so frustrating, so maddening I'm on the verge of using something else next time. Almost ANYTHING else. 

On top of all that your directions on how to efile one return and snail mail the other are very unclear. 

I do not appreciate one bit the way you make it difficult to not order your MAX service. Believe me, next time it will be your mini service. 

It takes real genius to do such a thorough job of degrading a reasonably good product. However, it's not the kind of genius most of us aspire to! Software Refused to take required corrections | 90992489|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|355

3 | Filed Late, 1st attempt did not work We thought we filed. Went through all the menus as prompted. However, we did not know that we were supposed to get a screen that said the return had been sent. OUCH! A few days after the deadline we checked Turbo Tax and found our return had not been filed. We went through the menus again and this time the program said the return was sent. I have used Turbo Tax for years. This is the first time I did not understand the e-filing did not work. Next year, please develop some sort of big red flag the shows up when you save and close the program that shows the user the return was not filed.  | 90992406|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|357
3 | Confusing but effective the US tax code is onerous. it perpetuates the need for software like TurboTax, TaxCut, etc.... If Intuit was interested in helping their customers, they would advocate for a more simple and fair way to determine taxes and put themselves out of business, and onto doing really productive thing. Your collective conscience will eventually come to its senses makes things right, and we will look back upon the present reality as the "dark ages" of our tax system. mostly blame our lame government for failing to govern | 90992070|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|358
3 | Many years turbotax user This year somehow I completed my entries and paid the turbotax fee but did not finish the actual filing. Since I owed, I expected funds to be deducted from my bank.

3 | IRS Deadline Change I was unaware that the deadline for the 1065 form was moved up a month. This seems like something that should have been called out in the program each time it was opened.

3 | frustrating experience -difficult to view your completed forms when you are in the software. sometimes to see if you input data correctly (especially for more complicated K-1 type forms, its good to look at the completed version of the forms while you are inputting data..i ended up just downloading a pdf version.

-when you go to e-file your return and it asks you to fix errors, the explanation is not clear, and the other frustration is that you cannot click through at that point to the input page where you made the error. there should be a quick link to take you there. i even had my accountant try to fix errors and this new version is frustrating --navigation is slow because you have to forward through every input page, no links to jump to reference pages either - Note i used turbotax for business last year to file the same information and somehow the program was a lot better and not so frustrating as this version. navigation is horrible | 90989631|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|368

2 | gave me wrong year download I've used Turbotax for the past 5 years or more but this is the first time I downloaded it. Unfortunately I had a problem that I could not fix on my own and had to call support. Trying to figure it out we found that TurboTax had downloaded me the wrong file and I couldn't open my saved data. It took about an hour and finally I deleted the application and they reloaded the correct one for me. Fortunately, it was able to read my save data file. Unfortunately, the rep asked to put me on hold and then disconnected me. Even though they had my phone number she did not call back. In the end I figured out myself what I needed to do. Overall very time consuming and irritating. Usually TurboTax works pretty well for me and I generally go with it because it will pull my data from the previous year making it easier/quicker to input. some explanations are not easy to understand | 90989353|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|371

1 | Terrable Support ! If I were rating your software between 1 and 10, I would give it a “1”. I have never been more frustrated before in my life. First of all, the health insurance section is very unclear. I have an marketplace account in NYS. It took me hours to figure out how to fill out the form 1095-A. When I finally finished my taxes, the review said I needed to fill that form in but never told me how to get to that page. I finally found in the list of forms at the top of the page but took me awhile to figure out how to edit it. In the end, my return was rejected 3 times. I did all that stuff you suggested to fix the error with no success. The error was IND-031-03. I opened my 2015 returns and wrote down the AGI from line 37 as you said. (Same number as TurboTax gave me). Still rejected. I tried to get a transcript of my 2015 taxes from the IRS as you suggested, my CC number did not match and my mortgage account number did not match so they locked out my request. The worst problem was trying to get SUPPORT from TurboTax. All I hear from you is “Don’t worry, we are here to help you fix the problem!” There is absolutely NO WAY to talk to a live person, not even a live chat. All your online support helped ZERO. I have been using TurboTax since 2002 but this is absolutely the last year I will never spend $60 again for software with NO live support. After the 3rd rejection I gave up and am mailing my returns. TurboTax would not even let me E-file my NYS returns which are mandatory for NY. Not sure how that is going to turn out when they receive my taxes by mail.

2 | Will not use again I will not be using this product again. I thought that this would make this process a lot easier. But it didn't give me enough information. I also spent $100 on the business product which then said it didn't offer the forms I needed for my own business. Was not able to get a refund from the vendor because I downloaded it. I'll be going back to the real experts. Does not alert you to what you need before hand in enough detail | 90985456|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|378
3 | Shamano As far as preparing my returns, it did that, but my returns were rejected. I prepared 3 different returns, and each one was rejected, for 3 different reasons, at least 3 times, although my input was correct. I contacted a representative at IRS and explained the rejection situations, and she reviewed the situations, and asked which program I used, and I told her Turbo Tax Premier, and she used the program, and it would not go through for her, and she confirmed my data was correct. The program did not indicate that there was a bug or error in the program. So that I would not be penalized for filing late, she made notes in my files and told me to be sure I filed by tomorrow. I wonder if there was something that this version didn't connect to my data, because I have always used Turbo Tax Home and Business instead of Turbo Tax Premier.  | 90985223|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|379
3 | Double Check EVERYTHING For the first time since using TurboTax, our state return was rejected because the software pulled in the incorrect AGI from last year. It took awhile to figure out how to correct this. It was difficult to find a phone number to talk to someone. Our daughter went directly to the state tax site, input the data, and had no problem.

1 | e-filing suspended on last day Was given a wrong reason that e-filing didn't work. It was not because of the PIN.

3 | Not bad, but could be better I'm glad I got Turbotax, but I really got frustrated when I had to go back to add info to different sections. It works well if you go straight through, but they could make it so much easier to navigate to specific sections. There's an option to navigate on your own, but I had to choose either that or be walked through it. I would have preferred to have a bit of both. Also, it could've been clearer that I could add info for a different business BEFORE I finished with the first one. It looked like I had to add all the info together, especially with the way things were worded. For example, it assumes that aside from business use of a vehicle for a specific business, the rest is all personal. But I used my vehicle for several businesses. I got it after a while, but it could have been much clearer. very difficult to jump back to sections to edit | 90967082|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|385

Also, e-filing states cost way too much. Should be a nominal fee of $5-10. Also, using the paid online service for family members is way too difficult. Can't see forms or find ways to input info.

I then discovered that while they gov asks for your license info, it is not required to complete your return. The software did not provide me with an option to override this step and thus I had to submit erroneous information as I did not have time to receive my new license. I had to file late. What made it worse if that there is no phone number provided for special situations such as this. Speaking to a person (god forbid) could have saved me hours of time and late penalties. I am really upset. no human interaction | 90945836|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|394
2 | Not worth the money! This app is pretty easy to use. The check software is pretty efficient, and does a lot of assessment behind the scenes that make the filing process significantly easier than straight paperwork. However, I would not recommend this software over something like H&R Block's free online software because of the price. For Intuit's turbotax federal software, I had to pay the upfront $50. This included one state's software as well. Then, I had to pay $45 for the other state's preparation software, which other places would have still been free. Then the filing fee for each state was $25, so $50 total. This puts me at $145 to do my taxes already. On top of this, it cost $35 to have the filing fees deducted from my return rather than paying them up front. This brings my fees to $170. $170 of my hard earned dollars for some software that could've been replaced by the free filing services online, which last year cost me a total of $35 altogether. TurboTax also offers the $44 audit protection which I declined, but this would've brought my total to over $200. I don't agree with this nickel-and-diming practice where my return was only set to bring in $800, and now 1/4 of it was spent on disposable software that won't even help next year. I do believe I'll stick to the free alternatives rather than buying this software. The web accessible competitors may not be as "pretty" but they are just as easy to use and just as reliable, so for the significant price difference, I will happily use another service. nickel and dimes you everywhere with fees | 90945784|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|395
1 | Roth IRA contribution messed up Seems this year I had a lot of issues with maneuverability. Program seemed disjointed. Even though I submitted our Roth contributions correctly on the questionnaire- still shows correctly, the worksheet is reporting incorrect contributions without explanation. I'm sure I submitted incorrectly and will possibly be audited because of it. No direct line to call for help with this. Disappointed in 2016!

3 | nickel and dimed me I paid $100 for the program at Office Max. Then when it came time to file, I had to pay an extra $25 because I earned money in 2 states. Only 1 state came free. I ended up filing for that state 2 days later, and then it wasn't free but was another $44.99. So what I thought would be $100, ended up costing me almost double that. Next time I can just pay a few dollars more and have somebody else do it, and much faster. you have to keep paying to get it done | 90945469|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|397

3 |  I was disappointed w/a few things:

1) I wish ALL of my accounts /tax docs could be imported at one time.

2) Please make a few things clearer: i spent hours trying to more or less find the cost basis of my new home purchase only to find out I was no where near the amount of gain ($250k) to be eligible --it would've been nice to know that up front in BIG BOLD TYPE -"YOU MAY NOT QUALIFY IF YOUR HOME SALE DID NOT NET YOU AT LEAST $250K." -Pretty sure the vast amount of home sellers didn't net $250k....please let them know up front! 

3) Please make Retirement account distributions very clear that cost basis is a moot point! AND it will be represented on a 1099-R unlike distributions from sale of stock/bonds in taxable brokerage accounts. Your site asked me if i took the proceeds from sale of stock/bonds....which i did but it wasn't clear that IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S DISTRIBUTED FROM A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT!



My recommendation: allow "x" number of people to come to locations around the country to file their taxes while you observe them (your reps staying silent at first) and have people relate to you what their thinking each step of the way....documenting their pain areas, areas of confusion and frustration. When their ready to file, your reps can help navigate them to a properly filed return......they get a free filing and TurboTax gains invaluable insight to customer's confusion/concerns/frustration/etc.



That being said, i was very pleased w/how quickly my call was returned on the last night to file and just how pleasant both reps were......they will keep me returning for at least one more year.



Thank you,

1 | You did not help me!!! My son was in High School January - June 2016. A full student. He live in my home 12 months for 2016. He only worked 3 weeks in 2016. He earned $426.15 dollars in 2016. I know I can claim him. He didn't earn more than $4050.00 in 2016. He filed his IRS claim. Why did I have to delete my own dependent and loose a tax exemption? I know I can claim him. fix a reject now!!! | 90943836|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|403

3 | Pay more for same functionality! Paying more for the Premier version of TurboTax should garner better handling of timeshare rental income than in the past where it was simply included at no additional charge. Overall, it was still an OK experience, but I am still burned at the bean counters at Intuit charging more to handle it. Bogus decision for which the burns will stay for years. Timeshare rental income handling is vague. | 90943368|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|405

3 |  Perhaps fine for most people, but if you expect the same handling of K-1s and importing of brokerage 1099s as provided by the Home & Business program, you will be quite disappointed. 1099s must be entered manually, and the K-1 inputs do not even prompt for sale and cost basis data. Those have to be handled via the Schedule D related inputs, and it seems that the necessary basis adjustments for partners requires the taxpayer to know much more of partnership tax law than such a program should presume. weak handling of K-1s, too much manual input. | 90942633|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|407

3 | 2nd State Errors My company will not and did not pay Alabama state taxes. The W2 reflected this by leaving the fields that show this blank. TTax left the Form 40 cell blank instead of entering $0.



I entered $0 for amount of state taxes paid. Hope that fixes.



TTax did not walk me thru this fix. I had to enter it directly on the state form.

3 | Confusing price structures The sophistication of the program to calculate and check is outstanding and deserves five stars. Figuring out what you will really pay or if you have the wrong product or if you need to go desktop or online version or if you want to do online, but you have data on a desktop version and they are not compatible to import is quite another thing. I wish they would just say it is going to be $25 per return rather than profess that they have a free product that is going to require more money if you want to import stocks or more money if you are going to need a second state because your daughter is in another state at school or more money if you want to file online with any state. In summary I find the product to be excellent, but the bait and switch pricing structure to be misleading and frustrating. I tried to find out what the pricing was for the yearly upgrade and it would not tell me unless I signed in and started the process of getting it. I think that Intuit has left a door open for a straight forward pricing structure company to take advantage of this. Takes forever to find out how much it actually is going to cost and what product is really needed | 90941573|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|414
3 | Late filing This is the second year I have used this program for taxes. Last year was a learning curve and was easy to understand. This year, the system would not let me use the status of married but filing separately and wanted to change to single. (Had been filing single since separated 2010 and filing separately). He filed before me this year with the first status I chose. Mine was rejected because of filing status. I received the email (10 am or so EST), went to the site unable to access anything such as request an extension or see what I needed to do. I was unable to access anything. The status of the files was still "pending" on the screen. My taxes are filed late and I will be penalized on top of what I already paid. Mistakes | 90941257|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|415
2 | TurboTax is too intrusive When I tried to file on 4/18, TurboTax didn't let me because an EIN number was missing. No way to override is too intrusive. Using TurboTax installed on my computer, the federal extension function didn't work, and I had to create an account on TurboTax.com to file extension.

1 | WORST EVER I have used Turbo Tax for 30 + years. The last few years the software has really gone downhill. Some of the walk thru questions are incoherent. The help and search functions are not helpful an barely useful... if you can find what you're looking for by searching responses by consumers. The review and correct function doesn't always take you to the correct variables. Your directions for entering IP PIN are wrong, saying to go to tabs that don't exist. Let's not forget the fun of scrolling to the bottom of ever page when finished with a section, rather than being returned to where you were.

3 | Hidden Charges this year Easy to use product but this will be my last year using Turbo Tax. They slide in the $35 charge to deduct the $25 to file your returns. This is all free at the IRS site.

3 | Personal opinion Although filing for federal extensions are generally quite painless, I could never understand how or if the filing of extensions to ones state are accomplished. I only get one form, generally to mail in, for a federal extension. The is nothing to send in for the "Utah" state tax extension. I'm not sure if one E-files their Federal return, that the state is notified by the IRS that the state return is also extended, since I cannot find out how exactly how that happens. It's an unknown. Also, Utah at least charges $25.00 to E-File state returns, so the mail in extension is therefore desirable. Who wants to pay $25.00 to file a state extension form?



More information on this (within TurboTax) would be a plus. Problems, mainly with state tax extensions | 90940645|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|422

2 | Difficult time with TurboTax 2016 This year’s TurboTax return was not a pleasant experience for the reasons below.



1. Step-by-Step navigation is cumbersome. To get back to a particular item to check it or make a correction, you have to page through all steps from the beginning. Some selections aren't retained and must be re-selected each time you go back through (e.g., "does my business carry an inventory?" defaults to "yes" and must be reset each time). Once a value is selected, it should stay until changed by the user. The S-b-S steps should be outlined somewhere so you can jump in where you want to go (e.g., to change an estimated value), just like the Forms view is without having to go back through all the steps. 



2. One of the primary reasons I have used TurboTax in the past is that it helps keep me from violating IRS and State regulations. I discovered this year that the NC State software didn't ask a key question about the applicability of the Bailey Exemption to my military retirement pay. This excludes my entire military retirement from NC taxable income. I caught it this year because I questioned the taxable amount. It took me some time to review the law and find the TurboTax button to fix it, but the software never asked me about that particular selection, even though it asked me if I was a veteran. Unfortunately, I missed this error last year and paid the amount TurboTax calculated. The result was a $4,400 overpayment for my 2015 taxes, for which I must now file an amended return and wait up to 20 weeks for my refund. 



3. The TurboTax Updater wouldn't update my software. I had to do a manual update. This cost me many hours on the phone with Tech Support (Case #424022607). 



4. TurboTax didn't carry my 2015 report numbers forward. Tech Support helped me, but I had to start a new return, which cost me two days of work. I recommend you provide a way to do this after the return is started. 



5. My wife and I own a small business and need to itemize expenses for Schedule C. To get the largest deduction in my state (NC), I had to split my business income and expenses equally into two separate businesses, one for me and one for my wife. I had to be sure both businesses were exactly symmetrical. This proved to be extremely cumbersome (See #6 below). I recommend a selection that allows you to enter the data once, then split it, or perhaps fill in one business, then duplicate it and change the Name of the business so things are at least binned symmetrically. Once you split the business, you then need be able to go and correct some things that aren't exactly symmetrical, such as Medicare Part B payments, on a line-by-line basis, but setting the two businesses up should be simplified. 



6. Trying to balance the duplicate businesses was made more difficult by the way the step-by-step process labeled the expense categories. The Schedule C Expense Summary lists the expense category names but not the Schedule C line numbers to which the expense category applies. In #5 above, I needed to be sure both business expenses were identical. The only way to see the big picture (the line item to which each expense is charged) to compare them was to print out the Supporting Details, but the printout refers to the line numbers, not the titles. This makes entering the second business numbers in the right order very cumbersome. Hard to use, cumbersome, time waster | 90940004|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|427
3 | Historical User Review Turbo tax is a great program to use. My mother had an accountant do her taxes and then asked me to do them for her using turbo tax. Turbo tax was spot on.



Although redundancy has been an issue with previous versions of turbo tax, it became more of an issue for us this year. We entered information into turbo tax as questions came up. But when we finished and the review was performed, turbo tax reported that we had errors. Turbo tax required us to re-enter the same information on worksheets and schedules. Why didn't the information transfer directly as we entered it earlier? Going back to figure out these "fixes" cost us a lot of time.



It was not always easy for us to understand how to "fix" the problem. 



Turbo tax should provide a direct link to the document that requires fixing instead of us trying to locate the form.



 Sometimes it was hard to understand what needed fixing when one question was asked out of context of the whole document/schedule/worksheet, etc.



I called to speak with someone about navigating through turbo tax. Sadly, she was irritable, short and impatient. I should point out that she probably had thousands of other calls like mine. Still, I did not feel great afterwards since we were feeling the pressure of getting our taxes done.



Although I rated this year's tax version as average, turbo tax is still a great way to go. We have used it for several years and we recommend it to others when asked. Information entered did not transfer to supporting documents. Errors came up requiring us to re-enter info on schedules | 90939797|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|428
1 | Hidden charges The system of actually getting the taxes done was fine easy to use software my issue came when I thought I was paying my taxes I actually was paying for their fees first. Found out thatbecause of my filing status I had to use, it changed me from free file all the way up to a $50 Edition. Then on top of it, it charged me an extra $20 from a third-party vendor to use a credit card. When I called to contest the charges they refused to refund my money. Took hidden fees to file | 90939436|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|429
3 | Last Day Rush Federal return rejected and when I corrected it the amount due jumped causing another error of Credit card needed to be reset, 3 phone calls and 2 emails later, with 2 case numbers, the return was filed but not paid. Now I am late and must write a check? No help on the last day. Big problem, only one in 5 years but it will hurt the wallet weak help on line and phone | 90939356|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|430
1 | errors in IRA Distro New Jersey even though all entries were correct in the NJ portion of the IRA distro it kept hitting me for an error where PART 1 line 4a and 4b cannot both have an entry. It had a zero populated in line 4b which I could not remove nor get around in any way. I spent maybe 1.5 hours with your tech support person on 4/17/2017 to no avail. even he could not figure it out and we both finally gave up. we deleted NJ and started over, tried many permutations of numbers, downloaded and installed the latest and greatest patch. Ultimately I had to file my taxes by agreeing to bypass the error and move on knowing it was erroneous. I fully believe it is a programming error where some variable is set in the program and no matter what you do it cannot be unset and continues to cause the error routine to trigger. "Bad code" error triggered where there was none | 90938999|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|431
2 | Taxes While it was easy to use and imported my w2, it said filling would be free. It was not until I filled out all of my state taxes and was ready to submit that it told me I would have to pay 30$ to file my state taxes. At this point I had already done everything and I would have just found a different program to use so I didn't have to pay, but it was too late at this point. Then when I chose to take it out of my return there is a 35$ "processing fee" which is outrageous. I didn't have a credit card on hand to use so I was pretty much forced to use this option and ended up paying over 60$ to file my taxes when in the beginning it stated it was free. Also I did not like how they kept trying to get me to buy the 30$ "pro tax" version that doesn't add much besides being able to talk to someone live. At the one point it made it seem like it was my only choice to keep filing because the no thanks button was hidden. While the software was helpful, I won't be using it next year because I don't want to pay 30-60$ for something I could easily fill out on my own. It was my first time doing my own taxes so I was scared it would be hard, and thought this was my best choice, but I'll just stick to doing it myself. Fees. Said it was free. Ended up being charged. | 90938906|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|432
2 | Unexpected Charges First, you have to purchase a CD (Or from the internet) and download the program onto your computer. THEN when you get done with the stressful process of going through all of your taxes the program charges you to file your state return?! I already paid once to use your program. I shouldn't have to pay to file. Expect me to go back to H&R Block for this stupidity.

1 | Getting worse I did 3 returns this year in my family paying for 3 different copies and versions. My return was overpriced for the jackpot simple return it was. On my daughters return, TurboTax failed to renew it's deal with GoDaddy, eliminating importation of the accounting data from her ETSY store, and making for tons of manual entries. On my son's return, it incredibly created totally unneeded Forms 8824 & 2106, trying to create depreciation in a case where a few miles were deducted based on standard mileage. TTax people insisted the forms were necessary (totally wrong) and neither the software or the help staff could/would delete them. I had to print and mail the return in order to have them not included. These matters also made me so aware of the inability to work directly on IRS Forms (a feature back when) and print them as one goes along. Also, the add a picture feature is an unnecessary mess. too many | 90938369|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|434
1 | I was forced to pay 54.99 I used this because filling a federal return was supposed to be free. But because on one of my W2's there is a deduction for an HSA account I was forced to upgrade. And honestly if I was going to pay, I would have just paid to have someone do it for me. Like I paid 54.99 for what??? I received no "expert help" no "24/7 service". It was a huge rip off. I'm so upset right now. This is a scam. Oh and it's best I don't upload a photo. Because the photo I would upload, would be a middle finger. A huuuuuuuuuuge middle finger.

1 | Discount not applied I opted for the more expensive option for my tax return, that was supposed to maximize my return because they were promoting a discount code/percentage.

2 | Could improve a few things Turbotax is the smartest dumb program I know. Why it is not more user-friendly is beyond me. It will not let you jury-rig the forms nor tinker with certain deductions such as the Home Office. Some parts of the questionnaire are very misleading. For example it posed questions about for both my son and myself rather than individualizing it. The result I think was that the program thinks I got Obamacare when in fact it was my son. Hope this doesn't cause any problems. Very confusing. Not well-designed at all. By adding a few more nuances the program could be made much more user-friendly. Every year, I get frustrated but there is no competing product. Sometimes Turbotax gets stuck. One can't just jury-rig the forms.

TT online gave suggestions (which I followed) but none helped. Tried to access prior tax returns. TT wont allow. Tried to call would not let me speak to anyone. TT couldn't find me in the system.

1 | Misleading/Dishonest Too many additional charges along the way. You do have the choice of accepting the upsell (or not) before the sale transaction takes place and you're being charged. But even a fee to use your card to pay the taxes owed. Next year I'll hire an accountant before I utilize Turbotax. Also, the program closed one of my windows that I wanted to print the contents of. I hope I can recover that one. In my opinion, the convenience they are offering the consumer is not worth the price of admission. My irritation here is their dishonesty via lack of transparency. Hardly 'Free' with an abundance of charges and upsells. | 90936150|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|443

3 | turbo tax issues Only have 3 issues, It's great program, but for a 100.00 bucks it's not too much to ask :



I load turbo tax ,do my taxes, print and file, then DELETE it from my computer, putting it on a thumb drive. I've been hacked and don't see the need to keep such sensitive files vulnerable.

When I reload turbo tax I access the thumb drive then it loads my name and address...

 It doesn't however, keep track of my: carryover deductions;

 any investment losses;

and info for comparisons on my rental profit and losses from year to year.

These are subjects that make self filing hard, and the reason I'm willing to pay for software.

I realize it was my responsibility to make certain it was correct, but in the past, personal information such as SSN were automatically brought in from previous returns. For some unexpected reason, the CD we purchased this year at CostCo (for about 1/3 the online cost) did NOT communicate with our previous years' online information. I would expect TurboTax to do better by longstanding customers and allow communication across different versions.

Now this morning I seem to have been able to file but this is inexcusable to be late due to your ineptitude. I called and spoke to your machines who couldn't find my account either. I tried to change my password and open a new account which also didn't work. Many many times I attempted to be recognized by your system but until this morning I could not get in and file. You should have had me because I have filed with you before, last year. I do not plan on a rosy photo spread with my comments because I do not recognize the relevance of my marriage status and number of children, home ownership etc. to the service you did not provide on time.

3 | Turbotax needs work! Long-term Turbotax user, but disappointed this year by how much paper the program generates to printout! 186 pages! Every one of my Charitable Deduction Worksheets, even when it was just a few dollars, generates 3 pages, when only the first page is necessary. Trees are falling everywhere for no reason! Also, I wasn't allowed to e-File my VA taxes simply because I had $50 withheld from a total of $183 earned substitute teaching, because it exceeded 25%. You telling me that one minor paycheck is enough to prevent me from e-filing in VA? And what happened to the days when TurboTax would allow you to generate a CD or DVD with the program basics and a copy of your return, so you're not dependent on a mere electronic file copy or paper? And finally, why doesn't the FILE tab include a "Save As" function so you can designate an alternate place to save a copy of your return? Right now it only has a "Save" function and gives you no say in where the return is being saved. Programmers have work to do to make this tax program as good as it used to be.

It turns out that the TurboTax does not allow entry of a 6 digit pin so although I typed 6 digits only 5 were entered. Now I face penalties for late filing.

I hit Continue through the end to refile. that was at 8 pm 4/18/2017. the next morning (3:52 am) there was another IRS rejection notice from TT. Went back into TT to find a question about wife's birthdate. It was noted as 2016. which was incorrect. I corrected it and refiled. The point is: Why didn't TT take me there the first time? Now I have filed a day late and probably will have a fime to pay. It did not find an error that IRS did and mine was rejected. | 90917028|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|470
1 | Never Again Used TT before w/o a hitch. This year sucked: I'd select a answer and go back later to find my answer changed to the default; tried calling but the 1st person couldn't see or understand my issue, after 20 min transferred but had to wait 40 min before someone answered, worked another 15-20 min and was transferred again except the wait time was now 101 min. I had already been on the phone over 1 1/2 so I hung up. Had 2 topics appear that I didn't recall seeing last year and couldn't find anyone with clarification. And last, our refund appeared in the corner box shortly after I began entering data and it never changed. Not even as I was going through deductions...not even after our medical deductions exceeded the standard deduction. How can that be right???? And we had an error that the "review" would sometimes find, sometimes not. TT was very frustrating this year. It's highly unlikely I'll be using it again. I've lost my trust. calculations didn't change throughout process; new topics appeared w/o explanation, couldn't get help; poor training | 90916901|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|471
1 | Too simple equals complicated; dummy support also I have been an H&R Block guy for many years, but this year I thought on would try TurboTax online - heard it was simple and easy. If you have itemized deductions and "need" a tax software, this is definitely NOT for you. Why? Because all information is entered only through the interview process and it is not possible to access IRS forms directly, nor are there any direct links to IRS pubs. Navigating back to a section to make a change requires completion of the entire interview for that section. 



My filing was rejected because name and SSN of one of my children did not match up with IRS records. The software told me about the error, but left me on my own to navigate back to the interview section I needed to correct, and then there was no ability at that section of the software to change his personal information - I figured out that I needed to go back to personal data and make the change there. I'm not sure this will get my filing accepted, but my point is that the software ought to have linked me directly to the place where I could correct the information, not search around.



Frustrated, I contacted the help line. Almost immediate call back, but the person was clearly not at all versed in the software and was just reading from the same "help" screen that I could see. No, no help. I can read. 



This software is garbage and I will never use it again. Back to H&R Block for me and if you have itemized deductions, I recommend you use that software which has both simple interview as well as an ability to very easily "go deeper" to research the information you need or enter information directly onto the forms. 



If you do not itemize, or have only a couple of simple itemizations, you are better off using the free IRS software I should think.

1 | Disappointed. Since this review is going to be sensored, I don't see much point in wasting my time. But I'll say that I spent 3 hours trying to get the confirmation code via email to file. It never came, not even the next day. I was told by phone to file an extension. Very comforting after TurboTax already had my money. "Don't request another email verification for at least 15 minutes" it says in a link AFTER it tells you to ASK AGAIN if you didn't get the email. TOO LATE. Now "it will be 2 hours to get the confirmation code" and there's only a small window in which to use that code before it expires.



So next day, I changed my email address, and some how I was never again asked to retrieve a code to verify my email address. It simply E-filed my return. There was no reason to ask to confirm my email address at that point when Intuit had just sent a payment receipt to that same email address.



Confidence Level: 2

Aggravation & Disappointment Level: 10



I know you won't post this, but at least fix it. You've got no right to take peoples' money and then not file their return on time. Disgusting.



I'll have to pay a penalty because VT requires a hardcopy of the FED Extension be mailed by the due date.



Yup, my fault for last minute, and also for my misplaced confidence in Intuit. Didn't ask about stock sales this year for some reason. Also didn't get the audit evaluation. Just not the same. | 90916492|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|474

Now I need to go find a professional tax person do deal with this mess. and its the day after taxes are do.



You display the amount of taxes to be paid it would be nice to see a count down of when you have meet your standard deduction. I wasted hours entering data to try and meet the minimum.

2 | Problems with e-file-- was rejected! My e-file was rejected twice after I corrected the return. Instructed by Turbo-Tax to file by mail which I did.

Not sure if IRS will now accept return or reject again and come after me. All the difficulties and delay left me mailing in after the deadline. So I owed money, paid a penalty for that, and may suffer yet another penalty for late filling despite my good faith effort. I have been using Turbo Tax with positive results for years, but now my confidence is shaken! e-file was rejected twice. Was forced to send in by mail. Very upsetting.

2 | not like previous years I have been using Turbo Tax for over 10 years. It seems to get harder to use year after year. I was really confusing for me this year. I did't like it at all. to much back and forth then having to log back on too many times. I understand that it is needed for security. It was just a little redundant.

1 | Hire a Professional This year been the worst. In prior years, I've had issues with TurboTax costing me money because of its difficulty of use when you are not a simple 1040 filer (even though I pay for the premier or self-employed). This year, forms were duplicating and information wasn't transferring correctly from prior years. 



I was the advised by a representative to "try" self-employed this year, and if it didn't work I would be refunded the difference between it and Premier. I was also told that my account would be notated about this. Wow, then my info is transferred to the upgrade and I can't go back to Premier without clearing all of my info (hours worth) and restarting my filing. 

Then I reached out to another rep to answer a question, and he said I needed to pay for my federal filing so that I could see my forms. I discussed with the rep that I didn't need self-employed and he said "if you didn't need it, you should't have bough it" and "you agreed to the terms". Then to top it off, when I go to file my return I am charged for two states because I already paid for the Federal earlier in the day to just review a form, and you have to buy the two together to get the one free state. This doesn't even really encompass everything, but this is the summary of my week with TurboTax. I don't know with how this went if this will be a service I'll be using in the future.

I found it difficult to get specific information on why certain deductions were not allowed.

1 | Don't feel like the result was accurate I initially tried to file on my phone, but every step of the way, the mobile site lagged, or timed out while I looked up information in my paperwork or in other opens tabs on my phone. I would have to start completely from scratch every time. Then, later, when I checked traditional ira instead of roth ira by mistake, it wouldn't delete the traditional contribution even after I went back and unchecked it... and re-entered all the following prompts... like, 4 times. In the end I had to drive home, and do it all on my laptop. It would have been faster to have done it myself with a pen, paper, and calculator. I'm not even sure the money it says I owe is accurate. Even this process to leave a review is time-consuming and inconvenient, but I'm following through just to warn others who might want to do this on their phone. laggy, glitchy mobile site | 90915185|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|486
3 | Used it a lot through the years but... I like the step by step guidance and user friendliness, but I don't at all care for the sudden price hike. Also don't appreciate the fewer and fewer features you get if you don't go big and buy the ever growing more expensive package, which is constantly being pushed on you all along the way. I can understand the upsell when I'm using the free edition, but I spent a hundred dollars on my return today to get the "deluxe" edition, but was made to feel like I was cheaping out, and got an extremely short list of features, when the deluxe used to offer much more at a lower price.

3 | Great, except...some hiccups that prevents efile The TurboTax works pretty well except for some hiccups. If there is an error, it only brings up that one field and will not help find the area that's needed to fix. Kept asking for S corporation, had no idea why, and could not find the beginning of the problem so was holding up the whole efiling process. There has to be a way to delete some stuff. Some files entered, shows the list and an EDIT button but no way of deleting it. Very frustrating, had no time to work that out. TFX files not downloading correctly, and no support.

1 | I feel like a fish I've used TurboTax for years and been very happy. This year, however, I feel cheated. They get you to input all this info, then halfway through tell you that you no longer qualify for the cheaper version. You have no choice but to agree, or spend all that time and effort on another site. Details regarding community property states are sparse. I still have no idea what I did, why, or if it is correct. I feel I spent a lot of money and received no support. Then when I went to pay my taxes I find I get to spend another fee to use a credit card. Thinking up to $10, okay. Then I find it is $76! And that's just for Federal. There is no longer an option to print your state return and mail it in. You are forced to pony up the $40 to file online. Overall I feel incredibly disappointed in a product I've recommended to many. They reel you in then snap the trap | 90915144|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|490

1 | Very frustated and disappointed I bought the TurboTax disc for the computer this year instead of going through the online site. When it came time to file and pay, I decided to pay with my credit card due to the fact there would be an extra $34.99 fee for deducting my state filing fee from my direct deposit. I choose not to do that so went through the credit card payment process. After filling out all the personal info, I was continually led to an error screen stating I needed to put in an email address for my contact info. Problem was, there was no way for me to do so. Where it said email there was no block to fill in to the right of it as all other info to fill out had. I was stuck in a vicious circle. I even signed in online, went to my account info, made sure my email was entered there, saved it, and signed out in hopes that that may fix the problem. I tried filing and paying again and still continued to get the same error message. Basically, I was told to put in an email that TurboTax wasn't set up for me to put in therefore I couldn't file and pay for my taxes with my credit card. After spending way too much time and effort trying everything I could think of, I ended up going back and reluctantly choosing to just have the filing fee taken out of my refund which cost me an extra $34.99. I wasn't happy, but had to file so I did so in the hopes that when I contacted TurboTax during the day, they would refund me that forced fee. I should not have to pay that extra fee. I did take pictures of the pages and error messages so it couldn't be blown off as me somehow not following instructions. There was no way for me to type in an email address. So, needless to say, I was extremely frustrated, disappointed, and not happy this time around. There was a glitch in this year's system that was extremely time consuming and frustrating. | 90915106|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|492
2 | A few unpleasant surprises So there I am, at 11:55 PM on April 18, about to e-File. I've run multiple checks on my returns (federal + 2 states) and each time TurboTax has assured me that everything is correct. I click on "Transmit My Returns" and then -- and only then -- TurboTax discovers there's a problem with one of my state returns (it doesn't bother to tell me which one). It informs me that some residency box needs to be checked that I haven't checked (why was this not taken care of in one of the 5 times I went over the residency section?), and then it gives me two equally indecipherable options (full of negative strings like "not a non-CA non-resident") to choose between. I click on "Forms" to try to figure out what is going on, but I can make no sense of it. With time running out, I cross my fingers that I've checked the correct box: it's impossible to tell. When I return to Easy Step, of course, it makes me start at the beginning of the "File" stage, which adds on another couple minutes of clicking through questions I've already answered. 

So, as feedback, TurboTax, perhaps in the future you could ensure that your "Smart Check" actually checks -- smartly, of course -- that every part of the return is complete BEFORE letting users start the filing process.

In general, I find the identification of errors during the checking process to be very stressful. In sharp contrast to the relatively helpful and plain language of the EasyStep process, the error messages are full of opaque references and abbreviations that leave me scratching my head.

1 | If you Itemize don't use Turbo Tax!!!!!!!! I absolutely would not recomend Turbo Tax if you need to Itemize Deductions.

3 | I feel like I missed some deductions. overall it was easy to file. me and my friend both filed at the same time however she is employed and I am self employed. her version was definitely a lot less complex but its understandable. I wish there is a way they can organize the listings of deductions a little more clear for people like me that are new to filing self employed taxes. either way it was learning experience and ill be ready for tax season next year. sometimes I felt like I couldn't understand what it was asking me. | 90915065|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|497
3 | Surprise at verification info needed at the end 1. Some questions are very vague (e.g. "..5% owner of business..".



2. Me and my wife are filing on "married file jointly" for the first time this year. I spend several days before 4/18/2016 working on my tax and when I am ready to file around 11.30pm on 4/18/2016, I am caught by surprise at the amount and types of info needed to e-file (prior year AGI for my wife, state/driving license ID and State) and was frustrated that TurboxTax did not inform me that we needed this type of e-file required info earlier and I ended up missing to e-file by 10 mins!!!!!!! and the e-file date on pour tax file is now 4/19/2017 :((((( TurboxTax should have warned us to get those critical info! Also, TurboxTax asked me "Did you file IL tax last year? I answered No, and TurboTax ask me "did you....about IL" and I answered No. But then I CANNOT proceed to efile and TurboTax said I have to paper file.... I have spent days preparing to e-file and it's 11.30ish pm. It's bad that TurboYax does not tell us these painstaking and needed info earlier!!!!!!! Very frustrated.... and TurboxTax does not tell me that it charges each state by $25! and I felt cheated and this caused me to not being able to include this extra 2 x $25 per state e-file expenses in my 2016 deductible personal expense! I can go on but this is enough... Some questions are vague, some critical info come too late | 90915064|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|498
1 | NON user-friendly I was unable to use the deluxe edition that we use every year even though we have not had any changes to our info. Each year we have 3 w-2 forms and one 1099-MISC to enter for income. This year we were forced to purchase the "self-employed" software for considerably more. And this program was confusing and promted me to enter the same info over and over for the 1099-MISC and Schedule C portions, each time noting that something needed to be addressed and then doubling and tripling the same info. Also, there was no option to skip the State return section. We can file FREE at the NM tax site but in order to file our federal return through turbotax, we had to also file our NM return, and pay an additional $40. There was no other option. Very disappointed with the changes to turbotax this year. We have used turbotax for 10 years but this was our last.

1 | Online filing I use the online filing for the first time, where I usually download the program. Then online is not user friendly and doesn't allow you to go back and correct information as easily as the download or hard copy. I will have to amend my taxes because if this. I can usually get my taxes done in less then two hours but this was so awkward I and unfriendly it was very frustrating and I ran out of time. Then the final review took me 10 min. to make corrections where the other would have taken me directly to the position. This caused me to be 3 minutes over the deadline. I wold never recommend the online completion to anyone. My first time and last time using the program in this manner. very unfriendly | 90915025|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|500
2 | Easy, but expensive Bottom line, if a service is expensive than it's not worth it. Almost $90 for something they don't tell you the price up-front for. If they had been honest and kept it at the $44 then the idea of being swindled last minute would've have eclipsed the intuitive help and ease-of-use the service provides. Unless the price is better managed up front, or they lower the price overall, I wouldn't recommend this service as HR block and TaxAct are cheaper.

2 | Been Better I've been using Turbo Tax now for over 15 years. This 2016 Version is the worst experience I've ever had. Its like they have taken things away like the helpful videos and don't answer questions when you try to log in online. I'm not sure I will continue to use it in the future. Very frustrating!

1 | Painful to navigate I don't remember having to go through so many details just to edit, or add, an item in a section that had already been done. This was especially frustrating when leaving a page to go find what was put down somewhere else. The end result would be 10-15 pages of going through questions that were already answered. If I opt out of being led by the hand, let go of my hand! I want visibility to the information I've already entered without spending minutes getting to it and back to where I need to enter it again. Not as friendly to edit anymore | 90914935|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|508
1 | Borderline extortion! I've never had a complicated tax return. I've always been able to use the free edition and pay for state, which I don't mind. That's an expense you expect. This time, I entered all the information and found out at the end that my return was complicated enough to require the $55 version. I cringed, but went ahead and signed up. Then, I needed some info off last years return, but last years was free edition on my husbands account, so I couldn't access it. I had to redo THE ENTIRE THING on my husbands account to be able to view last years return. Then I get to the payment part, and again they make me get deluxe, but I expected it this time. But that doesn't include state. Nor does it include "plus." But it looks like you have to buy plus to get deluxe? So, my $55 version, now cost $94 because I had to buy the preceding versions to get the next one. With state, all the fees came to $134. This is outrageous. I can spend that much at H & R Block, not have to do it twice, and have someone else do all the dirty work. AND have a paper copy I can reference next year if need be without having to reset my password or remember which account I was on. They know once you do the work of entering everything you're not going to want to walk away, so they can charge anything they want, and you'll pay it.

Thanks for nothing, turbotax! I won't be using you ever again! Don't find out about price gouging until after all the work is done! | 90914921|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|509
3 |  Was not happy that the very modest business expenses incurred couldn't be added this year without upgrading. Biggest stress inducer was that I somehow bypassed the state return and ended up sweating it out till 11pm on tax day before I could gain access to my return. could have saved more time and hassle | 90914913|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|510
3 | Turbo Tax Great for Federal, Terrible for State Turbo Tax for the most part is great for federal until you need to figure out a way to manually fix something, because I have NEVER had one year where I know for sure the Turbo Tax didn't do something correctly since I researched it, so there are lots of bugs in the software. This year it was about an inherited house in another state - of course, I had the Deluxe version, and perhaps the Premier would have helped, but TT didn't suggest that I upgrade. TT also thinks I needed to report whether my 21-year-old child had health insurance even though this year I didn't claim her as a dependent, and in AZ she was able to get free health insurance because of her low income and she reported her own health insurance info. I don't automatically trust everything that Turbo Tax does, and I only do the interviews to learn more about a topic since they tend to lead me down the wrong path. As far as state taxes, TT seriously needs to fix these, and fix the way it handles multiple states. Turbo Tax has been around for many years, and even though the state tax laws are constantly changing, they aren't changing that much, so there has been plenty of time to fix the software. May I suggest that you just have 1 package (not Deluxe, Premier, etc) that includes all the states and every situation and charge more for it? Then you can concentrate on fixing it in just one place instead of multiple, and everyone will have access to any possible situation, including multiple states. Have to pay for state returns, and even worse, pay more just to have the fee taken out of your refund! | 90914903|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|511
3 | colorado I was upgraded to business forms when I thought I was getting a discount through my bank. Sound credit union. Once I accepted the discount I got switched to the business account which I don't have and it would not switch me back to just itemized deductions which cost me another $50. It asked if I wanted to start over? No did not want to start all over I just wanted to be switched back to the original form I started. upgrade policy | 90914887|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|512
3 | Confusion This year I waited to the last minute to submit my taxes. I had previously prepared them, but I had a few questions that I wanted to speak to a tax advisor about. I was on hold for 40 minutes. Then a call center rep answered but he was not a tax expert. I was placed on hold a 2nd time. He then transferred me to another girl who was not a tax expert either. She later dropped my call to someone else's line. I was transferred 3x. Very frustrating just to get 3 questions answered. Now about the fees, I think TurboTax fees are becoming rather expensive. I would like to be able select Audit Defense without being charged $59.99 for identity theft protection that I already subscribe to through another company. I did not want to be forced pay extra for something that I do not need. I do not think that is a fair thing to do to customers. Inexperienced Consultant | 90914849|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|513
1 | User Experience I don't remember the experience being as frustrating last year.



1. If I click "Back" to make a single change, you don't need to show me that the "calculations are underway". Show me the previous page, let me get this thing done.



2. What if at checkout, say, I wanted to get rid of the joined tax filings (state and federal). There is no option to remove it afterwards.



3. If you're going to charge me for a ton of hidden things, make it supremely transparent, and stop asking 10 times for the same charge. Show me what it would look like WITHOUT the charge so I can compare it at a glance without worrying about "Oh no, I clicked Agree, but I only sneezed! How do I get out of it!?" Is there REALLY no way to take a feature off without having to restart the whole process? Because if I had to restart the thing one more time, I'd be done with the service. Frustrating experience. | 90914818|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|514
3 | Not as good as in prior years I work on my returns from 2 PCs, a desktop and a laptop, When I tried to load the tax files from the laptop, it would tell me that the file was not valid. I had to try to retrieve it several ways (click on file, open within TT Deluxe, or move file to another disk location). Never had this problem in prior years and I always worked on several PCs to do taxes. Files would not load when switching between computers | 90914803|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|515
3 | Fix Error Section At the end of the filling out the tax return it will ask to do a smart check to find any errors, but the problem is that it will not tell you which section the error is in. For example, it said that I needed to change information in section 179 deduction, but it didn't give me any helpful hints as to where it was located or what this section was able. I actually needed to leave that part blank because it didn't affect my taxes this years. I think Turbo tax took my info. from last years tax return and thought I still had the same info. this year. When I tried to enter $0 it said it was an error, so I put $1 and it still said it was any error. I hope this fix this error next year!

1 | SCAM Turbotax charged me for premium services even though I did not agree to it, actually I specifically pressed " I DO NOT AGREE" button. I saw a notification of premium service being automatically added.I looked up directions on how to remove it according to intuit, so I went back to payments, removed the premium service, entered credit card info for purchase, and it still charged me. I called customer support right away, because I haven't even finished filling yet. They called me back and said they couldn't refund me for a service I haven't even completed yet.

1 |  The amount of time required to process completed taxes is ridiculous when you have to enter your account number for Intuit before you enter your credit card number. I am a long time user of TurboTax, but this will be my last year. In your efforts to be more secure, you have become an arduous process. I spent over an hour trying to mesh my account number with your requirements. And my nickname is too short with 3 letters? Come on. Get real. Oh, my mistake. The four letter replacement I chose is taken? What the heck?? (Oh no, my original word at the end of the last sentence is also inappropriate. Changed to heck.)

2 | Fees and timing were no good TurboTax is easy to use but unfortunately if you have to file them later on you have to deal with ridiculous fees, especially if you were self-employed. Another problem I just realized is that where I am I still had a hour to file but according to TurboTax I just filed on the 19th, meaning my taxes were late.

1 | Unpleasant Experience Overall I have been using TurboTax for about 5 years as they are the preferred option through my bank. At first, I was very excited to use this program to do my taxes as they they usually make it easy for you to navigate. Not this year. I needed to make some adjustments to my HSA information and the program would not allow me to make updates AT ALL. I had to completely wipe out the form and start all over again (about 40 minutes of my time wasted). Major pain. It was also not helpful that TurboTax was unable to pull my previous tax returns so that I could input my AGI to e-file. That could have easily saved me an hour and a half of hassle and headaches. I will be honest and say that after being a loyal customer of TurboTax, I will be exploring other programs when filling my taxes next year.

3 | Not so loyal anymore This year it seemed more expensive and more complicated. I was asked how much I paid to complete taxes last year, shouldn't Turbo Tax have that info since i've filled every year since 2011 and maybe before. There are so many other options now that are way cheaper. I think I filed federal free last year. I paid this year because I had to enter 1 1099 for $600. Not worth it.

But I didn't and the time needed to find that one item put me slightly past midnight for filing. If I buy a DIY desk from a furniture store, the instructions plainly list all that I need to complete the project. Here I am with DIY taxes and it seems reasonable to me that Turbo Tax (with how many years of experience?) could extend the same courtesy and tell me at the outset that I will need my spouse's driver's license so that I have that information ready before filing? I only keep buying TurboTax because I used it the previous year and it imports easily. Maybe, I ought to give the competition a try next year?

3 | Still lost in the Missouri wilderness I can't believe that you still offer no help for Missouri non-resident returns after 10-15 years of complaining! You refer to forms for "additions" and "subtractions" from federal income and deductions without an explanation of what these are and sometimes not even a link to the documentation. My MO return has been amended by the state several times. Nothing serious, but extremely ANNOYING! 



Thankfully, this was my last year with any MO relationship and I won't need you again. This means I will be free to start writing about all the repeated questions and the incredible lack of connectivity to priory's years ("we got this number from your last year's return - is it right?") Heck (Intuit made me change this from "H*ll" because it was inappropriate - don't you wish you could hang around their customer support and see how they talk off the phone?), it was prepared with your software and stored with your formats, don't you know for sure if it's right?



Or maybe my life will be simple and I won't need you at all.... Then gets a little tired and can't handle much by the end! | 90914404|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|540

Still charged me for deluxe even though in hind sight I did not need it. | 90914321|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|548
3 | K1 Mishap TurboTax provides a generally easy to use interface but if you have investments with MLPs then you have to enter your K1 information which TurboTax does not handle smoothly. This year I ran into an issue because the foreign income had to be broken out into a separate K1 otherwise TurboTax would not allow submission. For this particular entity I had 3 K1s because of the awkward handling of K1s. I had the main K1 which reported most of the activity for the MLP, another for rental income and finally another for income from foreign sources. What a mess! K1s are arduous | 90914310|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|549

3 | One more thing... There is no easy way to mark something done v. guesstimated v. not needed. You end up going through wizards over and over unless you realized you need to hit "Edit" rather than "continue".

Worst of all, they hold you up creating accounts and entering financial details in a seemingly endless endgame that always takes you a few minutes past midnight. There has to be a way to get that up front, or put it all on one page rather than several. Keeps wasting your time doing things twice | 90914277|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|551
1 | Worse Every Year Every year this gets more confusing and gets you stuck in circular traps which are impossible to escape. This year, it wanted me to report farm income. I don't now, nor have I ever owned a farm. It also gave me an error over some medical plan type that I don't have. And it stopped on the filing because it said there is no TN State tax, but also wouldn't give me any way to remove that form. And it lost all the information that I put in last night, so that I had to start over from scratch again tonight. I could just scream!

1 | Poor help when using Premier turbotax Turbotax has poor help on all topics when filling and when using the Premier turbotax.



Too many repeat questions on the same the section or topic, why?



I purchased the Premier turbotax and the lasts stage of e-filing my FED and STATE tax return, a message read that I needed to purchase Premier turbotax for $39.99 to e-file my tax return, this was confusing because I used the Premier to do my taxes, that needs to be fixed.



I called the 800 number for customer support and waited over an hour, it's tax day, why don't you hire more people to help stop being cheap. After ,over an hour waiting for support the person on the other side of my call did answer my questions and was very helpful and kind.

1 | Fu#k Turbo Tax Turbo tax tricks you into filing with deluxe state and federal combined total of 89.99. Once you call to have them remove the deluxe package you will wait 40 min to talk to a real person. Then the person you have to talk to needs to constantly mail a supervisor, after wasting 2 hours on the phone their employees who I might add are snarky can't help you and they tell you to start your taxes over!

2 | Much More Complicated I have used TurboTax for years. This year, the user interface felt clunky and often it would ask me to make changes but wouldn't allow me to make the changes it requested. Additionally I would like to see an "Undo" feature. I edited a detail on one of my dependents and it dropped my refund by $600, was not able to get back to find out what happened and never got it back.

2 | HIDDEN CHARGES, NOT USER-FRIENDLY Mobile app used a combination of 'continue' buttons and swipes to navigate from page to page. super confusing. pick one, make it consistent. IT should be ALL swipes or ALL navigation buttons. 



I hated having to click through the entire flow to pick up where i left off. Also, when data is entered on the 'Other tax forms', users are unable to clear the fields. '0' values are populated to the carryover worksheet when user tried to remove/delete the invalid entry. I was prompted several times to update my carryover worksheet when there should not have been any data. SUPER ANNOYING. Fix the tax form pages (especially the ones with a 'next state' button).



Extra $34 convenience charge (not advertised anywhere) for deducting fees from the refund felt like a rip-off. 



Another thing about the user interface - I hated that you have to click on the 'X' button close a 'more info' popup. Users should be able to click anywhere outside of the box to close the window... EXTREMELY ANNOYING. Also, the "Was this helpful" button looks like a typical Close button. WEB APP IS NOT USER-FRIENDLY, MOBILE APP IS WORSE | 90914110|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|564

1 | Too expensive I have used Turbo Tax for years, but I think its time to find a new tax software. Too expensive and constantly trying to up-sell. Required me to upgrade to Premier just because I sold and bought a house even though there were limit tax implications. I got no other benefits from this up-sell. Also, software incorrectly wanted me to deduct point on a house I bought years ago. The state return price goes up every year. Too expensive | 90914003|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|570
1 | Not Impressed This will be my last year using TurboTax. I was using the "Premier" edition of the software, which isn't cheap, and it still doesn't provide any of the expertise that a professional tax consultant would give a client. I would much rather spend $250-$400 dollars to have a face to face consultation with a tax professional that could provide guidance, advice, and tips to minimize my exposure to taxes. TurboTax does none of that, and ultimately makes the client decipher and submit the information based on their interpetation of the steps in the program. TurboTax served me well for 10+ years, but it's time for me to give up the convenience of doing taxes at home and get true consultation to help my family from dumping more money into an unaccountable government than is needed. Hopefully Trump starts to fix these problems soon... Too expensive for what you get, and it's all on you to figure out | 90913986|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|571

So now I tell you, this long time customer is done, next year when you feel disappointed you don't have my yearly payment. I'm moving on to other options.

2 | State seems like an after thought. I like the Federal version - but it needs better instructions and guidance - should ask certain questions up front - like do you have a business, do you have rental property, do you have job expenses - these big things up front so it can then guide you through what info will go where! The State version has no guidance - it is just hey we entered some things but you probably will not get any info about what your state will allow as deductions etc.. Also paying extra to E-File State seriously should not have to do this - especially considering how extremely limited the state version is. State . has no real guidance of any kind. | 90913945|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|575
2 | False advertising I signed up under a promotion to complete my taxes at a discount through turbo tax, but when it came time to check out it cost me 3x as much as I expected despite not upgrading and choosing basic options.

2 | Some local forms are gone, as is my confidence This was my 3rd year with Turbo Tax. I was so happy that the 2015 edition included a couple of local taxes (the Tri-Met tax and the Portland Arts Tax), and they automatically popped up in my state step-by-step. This year, though, they were gone!



 I was able to find the Tri-Met form in the "forms" view, but I had to remember to look for it. I never did find the Portland Arts Tax form. Nor could I see where (and if) I could list them as deductions from my income, for either state or federal purposes. Now I'm not sure I can trust the Turbo Tax folks to be looking out for me. I find myself wondering what else they may have skipped. 



Here's another example: I'm over 65 and self-employed, and it's not at all clear to me that TT processed my health-insurance premiums as 100 percent deductible from my self-employment income (which I am aware is a new provision for over-65 people who are self-employed.

Where to input Retired Military pay from 1099R is still very vague and has not been addressed in Turbo Tax. There should have been a clear field for this input in Turbo Tax years ago. Would like to see a side by side comparison of the standard deduction vs the itemized deductions. When I did it on my own there was a 440 difference which appeared in favor of an itemized deduction instead of the recommended standard deduction. There are too many areas that are questionable.

Turbo Tax does not provide an adequate explanation for this nor does it permit me to override this to get my return filed. How am I to figure out why this is happening? I am at my wit's with this bug so I am de-rating this product down to three stars instead of five. If this persists, I will stop using Turbo Tax (after using it for 20+ years) and find another solution to getting my tax return completed. I really don't need this frustration at this point!!!

But, something changed in Expenses for 1099-Misc income that is forcing me to upgrade to Self-Employed when the income and expenses are minimal.

3 | Ripped off on state return The charge for the State eFile is a ripoff.

Will look into changing software next year. Purchased software box says $19.99 for each State eFile. Was charged $25 each. Ripoff | 90913263|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|611

1 | This is my last year with you I won't use Turbo tax again. Last year I was able to print the state before payment was requested, so I just sent the state in. Now you have to pay in order to even see a copy of the return, which I believe is a rip off. Another problem is that Turbo Tax is outdated. I receive income from renting out a room through Airbnb and when I tried to input that info, I was directed to pay for your premium product. I should have been able to add the extra $1,500 for the year but could not. It was not listed anywhere in your Misc section. I used to like Turbo Tax, but farewell. I'm sure others are equally as unsatisfied with it this year. Charging 29.99 to file state taxes when the refund is less than $200 is gouging the little guy | 90913257|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|613
1 | Nightmare! I have now used turbo tax for four years. Yes it's always had some quirks. But this year is absolutely the worst. From there insistence to process my taxes online to the software getting lost every time I tried to use the back button.

it seem to lose information or change it every time I needed to use it. Then efiled and had the IRS reject my return. I had an obvious error and I corrected it. But I owed money. since I had already paid when I resubmitted it wouldn't take my CC again. told me to contact Turbo Tax. Long story short 4 hours and four reps later at 11:00pm at night I gave up. I will never use this software again. Error prone and very poor customer support. Frankly no support. Never hit the 'back' button | 90913213|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|614

2 | Shame on Intuit and IRS First year filing on my own, trying to make in in the big city...had several W-2's and a single small 1099...and for that TurboTax forced me to file "self employed" and charged, even with USAA "discount," MORE than I will get back from IRS or even owe to NY in taxes? That's shameful and usurious. Surely you make enough on more elaborate returns to be more fair on tiny ones. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill. 1 freelance gig = self-employed??? | 90913196|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|616

3 | Mixed - good and challenges Generally things went well. It was annoying to continually answer same questions each time I came back in. I couldn't get back to page of institution and credit card entry. Hard to get question submitted. Tried workarounds that resulted in TT putting income from one employer into another place. I was able to undo it. I am unhappy about the charge for self-employed users and don't remember agreeing to that charge. I did not see milage in expense categories offered for self-employed. And other categories like license fees, trainings, etc., that are required in my profession.  | 90913133|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|621

2 | Back luck due to correct birthdate apparently the IRS rejected my efiled return because my wife's birthdate was wrong. It was right however! Then the return was bounced again and turbo tax told me that I should mail it. Then the turbo tax program put me right back in the efile routine and it was far from clear whether I was actually supposed to mail the return or, how to do it If I was supposed to do so. screwed me over... | 90913035|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|623

Never got 2 or 3 calls and number 4 was hours later only to hear they had glitches and people complaining. I guess so we pay good money for this. All of the business expenses transferred to the wrong jobs from federal into state. I still don't know why I paid for this.

1 | Horrible Experience this year I have been using turbo tax for the last 4 to 5 years, and I never have any issues but this year has been a total nightmare. Lots of software issues. I called multiple times to ask the same questions regarding either the software or taxes, and customer services or turbo tax experts were having doubts in their answers. At that point it made doubt if they have tax or software knowledge since a couple of times a called again to make sure the last expert was giving me the proper information. Nevertheless, I am not sure if I am going to use turbo tax next tax season.  | 90912922|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|631

1 | Pricing I switched to Turbo Tax this year, in an effort to save money. I had been using a competitor, one where you had them prepared on-site/in person. By the ads I saw, and commercials I heard, I thought I would be saving money. In the end, it cost pretty much the same. Except in this instance, I did all the work for the same amount of money I used to pay someone else to do it. Pricing is hard to understand | 90912889|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|633
1 | good refund year 2016, had many life changes and it complicated this years turbo tax refund for me on state taxes. It was the most complicated. I didn't understand it. Got out of the army in the fall, moved to a different state, but i worked for two months at the state i was only stationed in. That made things very complicated. Please try to make it easier and more understandable. That was not my resident state yet turbotax made me put a part time resident.

2 | Turbo Tax easy to use but not always accurate I have used Turbo Tax for 5+ years. I found out that I have been led to not report our IRA tax basis appropriately since we are over the income limit for the IRA contributions to be tax deductible. I now have to go back who knows how many years and send a letter explaining the reason on our next tax return. What a hassle!



This year I also had to leave off a small stock dividend payment that we received when a company we owned stock in was sold. The 1099-DIV did not have an FEIN listed, only 0s. I verified with the company that this was correct. Turbo Tax wouldn't allow me to efile my tax return with 0s as the FEIN number, eventhough that was what the company instructed me to do as the company reported 0s as the FEIN number to the government. Very frustrating and time consuming and still didn't get a resolution. The people I spoke with didn't even understand what I was talking about. It took about 2 hours on the phone before I could get anyone to understand, and they advised me to take it off and not report it. When I spoke with the company, they stated I must be using Turbo Tax because other tax preparation softwares didn't have this problem. 



Very disappointed. The software is "easy," but I'd rather have it be accurate! Doesn't work for those making over certain income limits | 90912849|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|637
1 | Completely awful This software is a mess. I had to pay twice to get my return to get through. It asked me the same questions a billion times, and I couldn't get a full refund because it wouldn't allow me to submit business expenses (because it said every time there was an error). Never using TurboTax again. What a joke. everything | 90912845|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|638

1 | The Waiting Game to the Music that Isn't Was told to delete deductions in order to change TT assigned sales tax #. Never told how to restore Schedule A info properly. After seeing I was getting a refund of $164 last night TT told me I owed $1640 today. I was astute enough to realize TT had changed my $20K+ of itemized deductions to the standard deduction. Again I waited on the phone for help in reinstating the Schedule A deductions - probably 7 hours on the phone, mostly waiting for someone to answer. It was supposedly accomplished, but when I printed the return A was missing - 5X. All that paper and ink - an ecological disaster. While waiting another 2 hours I happened to reboot my return, and Schedule A appeared. Now it was 8:30. Drove to a couple of PO's. Didn't realize they no longer stayed open late. By 10:30 I was having to figure out how to change to e filing. By this time I dropped my 1040 ES in a mailbox with a 10:15 pick up without a stamp. Not sure what will happen there.



There should be some general info that comes with TT - like how to delete a form and how to update your return by rebooting. 



If my Wi Fi isn't connecting me to my Network I know that I must unplug the router and refresh the signal.



I gave feedback already. This is new bad stuff.



Every year I say never TT again. I hope I'll be true to my word next year. Experts are duds. Had to find things out myself. Took forever. | 90912806|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|640
3 | Not an Intuit Fan right now. Turbo tax, like all Intuit products, works very well. Spectacular products in my opinion.! I am always impressed with their products. I used quicken for 20 years or more. I loved it! best software available. Apparently I have used used intuit products on an off since 1990, so thats 27 years! Their choices in how they now, attempt to extract money from its customers is suspect. 









Example: Just before filing, there is a blue box to click if you want to pay for audit insurance. I clicked this multiple times before realized my window had not been maximized apparently. There was another option below which didn't require the audit insurance. I finally saw it and acted appropriately. The question is not, "why didn't I maximize my window initially". The question should be, why would the default position of the window be to make it appear that choosing an Audit is the only way to go. 

The window was sized just in that way for a reason.



I have skipped around and used others services over the years. I felt like splurging this year on Turbo Tax. I know I have used other services who allowed me to file electronically and use U.S. for checks.

Turbo Tax charged me to E-file? I checked clicked through the mess because I was tired of thinking about. Was there some secret box I did not check which would allow me to file without paying Intuit? Should I have to worry about these things? Is it to much to ask that software not appear to have a secret motive? Intuit seems to be slick and more sophisticated, but they are not much different than those pop-ups websites, that present you with options which are not clear or appear to be a trap in some way.



I will actively search for options OTHER than Intuit products next year. The hardest things about filing my taxes, was determining just which fees I NEED to pay and which ones Intuit has manipulated me towards. 

In the end I paid aprox $100(software & filing fees?) and 2 hours, to file my State and Federal Taxes. I know that is reasonable. 

I truly do not trust Intuit's manner of presenting payment options.



Nobody likes to feel manipulated. Confusing payment options | 90912801|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|641
3 | 24.99 State E-file Was not happy. In the past it has always been 1 Fed and 1 State free e-file included in the cost of what I paid for the software. So I ended up paying for 2 State e-files and 1 extra Fed e-file for my son's return. I was already aware I would pay for the 2nd Fed e-file...so no biggy, but was not expecting to have to pay for a total of 2 State e-files. Just getting out of hand, really. Paid 24.99 each for 2 E-filed Stated Returns | 90912797|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|642
2 | fair to middling I really did not appreciate the State filing fee. Especially since I had to file in 2 States both of which readily accept turbo tax files. It felt like a bait and switch. First I had to pay for the extra State then pay efiling fees on both. The cost should be included in the cd. I have used Turbo tax for a lot of years. This will be the last. There are other programs out there that don't charge twice for the same service and don't charge for merely relaying a file to a State Revenue site. Bad business practice. You look greedy. Program (CD) froze time after time. Only program I've ever used that froze on a Mac. | 90912796|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|643

3 | Easier every year, but also expensive TurboTax continues to be a easy program to get my taxes done. However we could use a bit of a break on prices. It cost me $112 this year. For a company that spent millions blocking a bill that would have allowed pre-filled tax forms for many people to be sent in, how about throwing a bit of a price break on the program? If I'd had time, I would have tried out one of the alternatives, like TaxAct, that manage to offer a similar product for much less. Expensive | 90912771|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|646
2 | Gets worse every year I've used Turbo since I've had a personal computer (1998), but I wont use it next year. A $30 "convenience fee" to pay my taxes by credit card when I paid you as a tax filing service, is going to make me go elsewhere. Owing is an intricate part of taxes, but then you charge a 2.45% "convenience fee" when efile is the IRS preferred method & credit card is the only way to pay for efile.



The site has gotten harder to use, some directions are not clear without searching additional information. FEES, not self explanatory anymore | 90912704|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|647
3 | Gets the job done I don't need to see a screens telling me that I am almost done, or that I have just one more step, etc. The entire process is tedious enough already; if I am one step from being done with a section, then I want the next screen to be that last step. Instead of clicks that don't contribute to finishing the task, I would like to see a progress bar for each section. As complicated as the tax system is, this is not necessarily a simple request, but if I click on an option requiring additional forms, I would not mind if my progress bar went backward. I realize that some people probably would not like this. Too many clicks | 90912686|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|648
3 | Fed good, state poor I was filing married for the first time. Both Federal and State input templates were confusing as the wording often seemed like I should be inputting amounts relevant to myself along when in fact it should have been our combined numbers. TT's state of Delaware was confusing also. They wanted to know the split of certain amounts and tried to auto-input numbers as if they already knew but all the numbers were wrong and made things confusing. State auto-input numbers jacked up! | 90912683|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|649
1 | You get the stink eye.... HATE this program. Getting stuck in the repeat loop when the program does not recognize that the information is not going to change sucks. I had to print and send my taxes that way because your program would not let me move past details I did not have, and have never needed in the past.

1 | very dissapointed in customer service as a customer for the last 4 yrs today 4,18,2017 i called several times because i noticed that i was being charged 29.99 x2 for my taxes for some reason i could not accept the call back 4 times a very helpful agent helped me around 215 pm but unfortunately i was not at my computer when she called so i had to call back...a lady by the name of KIA called me back, frustrated because she could not understand y question nor help me she got very rude and at one point yelled at me saying either i let her do it or i can wait 24 to 48 hrs for a supervisor to call me...she told me to hold and then hung up on me...i was forced to pay the 29.99 twice in order to get y taxes in on time...very dissapointed in her customer service return call rep very unhelpful | 90912670|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|651
2 | Cost differences Not sure what the deal is with the pricing. I started out doing my return online at Turbotax but when i finished they wanted to charge me $95.00 to finish and file. That makes no sense. The program if purchased from the Turbotax website is $54.99 for deluxe with state and free federal filing. To file state it will cost $24.99 so that's $79.98 not $95.00. And if you purchase it from a retailer like Target or Walmart it is normally $34.00 or so for deluxe with state. Add the state e-file and you get a total of around $55.00 which is the price of just the software on Turbotax website and a lot less than the $95.00 they wanted to charge me for doing everything online at their website. You should really figure out your pricing guys........ Price is different depending on where you get it | 90912647|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|652
2 | On my own If im going to be paying over 100 to file my taxes I would rather pay someone to do them. My filing experience this year was no different than using the free version so I am not sure what I paid for. Also, the site stated the cost was 94 dollars and as an uber driver I was offered 20 dollars off but when I filed it stated the package was 114 and now 94 with my discount. Feel completely jipped on that one especally because I did not get any extra assistance or benefit of paying for a different turbo tax version. I will be using a free provider next year or pay someone to do it. hard to find answers specific questions, paid for services that I did on my own | 90912644|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|653
1 | Where is my 1 free state efile? The software stated that I would have 1 free State efile, then it charged me 24.99 at the end for the State efile.

2 | Paid too much I think you charge too much for state filings. I had three states to file in. By the time I got done I was paying $200.00. That took all of one refund and more. I think you should offer discounts if a person has more than one state to file in. There are other programs we will use next year that do not charge anything.

3 | Overall good, one huge hiccup I had a weird W-2 with no line 1. due to that I was not able to file electronically and as I had to pay I waited until the last minute to file and pay. unfortunately I wasn't expecting the non efile option and had to scurry to get my tax forms filed in time. had the system told me this was going to be an issue when I started filing in March it would have been far less stressful for me u don't know what u don't know until you go to file | 90912578|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|657
2 | Not the Easiest Version Ever TurboTax All in all I was able to get done with my return, but I will tell you it was pure heck. The tax codes need to be simplified at this point. I am on year 35 of doing taxes and this is out of control! All of these extra forms and details are just making doing your taxes unbearable. I also feel that the price of paying for one additional State is ridiculous as I paid $10 more for it than I did for the entire software program from Costco. 



Filing fees for two States also cost more than the program as well. Way too Complex and No Easy Access to Forms | 90912565|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|658
2 | Too expensive I'm very dissatisfied with the almost $60 I had to pay. The only reason I paid and went with you is because I had no choice since it's the last day. I will not be using you next year. Prices keep going up | 90912530|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|659
3 | Hidden Fees When I bought the TurboTax basic disc (for $29.99), it said on the back that states are $19.99 or subject to change without notice. I had to pay $24.99



Further, there was no warning on the package that you also had to pay $47.51 for state software.



So, the disc was upfront, but the state e-file was $10 more, and there was a hidden software fee.



This is a total of $102.49 for something I thought was $49,98. Ugh. Hidden fees | 90912516|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|660
1 | It really blows!! It doesn't matter at all to you. I put together a "free" tax prep for my friend - who makes very little - and of course he can't make out his state tax (which took all of 2 min) without paying the $30. So your "free" tax prep is really $30. 



As for MY tax prep, I have an agreement with the IRS to pay within 60 days, but wanted to at least pay a partial sum - only you can't do that on Turbotax. The wait time for an expert was said to be 39 min - 50+ min later I called again - this time I was told 56 min. I had to file (and did so) and of course, the expert called 10 min after I was done. Another thing is you don't find out until the very end that NYS won't take payment by credit card - only debit or mail-in. Oh well, looks like I'll get another penalty. Great.

2 | To many redundant questions to file I have used Turbotax for years but this years version really drove me crazy. When i finished and went to e-file it asked me for my email several different times as well as my name, address and phone number. I mean come on i had entered it a few times already during the process of setting up my tax return. And now it asks for several different things before filing like drivers license number and issue and exp date and previous years AGI (Which you can get instantly online from the IRS even though Turbotax never mentions that as an option). Then when you chose to pay for your e-file with a credit card it takes you to a separate window where guess what.. you got it more email, name and address to fill out...... Make it simple again please. Redundant questions to efile | 90912444|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|664

1 | Worst Option for Tax Return There were multiple forms that I didn't think were being filled out correctly. Would definitely recommend just going to a H&R Block or someone to actually do them.

2 | Helpful, but only ok I know you need to make money. But this program is too expensive. Don't get me wrong, its a convenient product and I understand why you charge for it. But, it is crazy for me to pay $100 for this, when I am only getting a $300 return. Maybe the prices are fine for California or some other place, but they ought to be prorated by the Cost of Living for where people are filing. constant upselling | 90912313|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|670
1 | Unnecessary Extra Fees Added After paying for the Premier TurboTax license, I was surprised to find an additional $30 fee required before I could send or print my tax return. After speaking with the online help, I was told that the fee was for efiling. Once I pointed out that the My Fees section indicated that the additional fee was for Self Employment (which I am not), I was told my only options were (1) I could pay the fee or (2) start my tax return over because they were unable to remove of refund the additional $30 fee. This happened at 9:15 PM on April 18, 2017 - nice timing Intuit. This fee was not imposed on earlier versions of my return and mysteriously showed up the day I tried to efile. And Intuit was unable to fix the issue. Very disappointed with the ransomeware you imposed on me. You are losing a customer of over 20 years.

Your tactic of holding extra deductions without paying extra fees should not be legal. I am actually going to call a lawyer friend and see if it even is! 

Next, you charged for paying with my IRS refund?? I NEVER saw this until I was done! Where was this charge?? Buried in that long statement that no one ever reads? I will Never, Ever use Turbotax again. I believe you just committed fraud. For what you just charged me I could have gone to a personal tax accountant!

1 | not free as advertised my credit union MAFCU advertised free tax return using turbo tax. after clicking on the appropriate link and going through a 2 hour tax return process, turbo tax still charged a regular tax filing fee. the free advertising is not transparent and I still do not see why the free offer was not honored. very frustrating. will not use again. not free as advertised on MAFCU | 90912195|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|674
3 | Getting a bit wordy. I've used TT for years and a few years ago it just started defaulting to the deluxe version rather than the free version. Meh...



The service itself is nice but they need to simplify some of their wordings as while it's not legalese so to speak some of the descriptions for deductions were confusing.



In some cases it will refer to an expense, interest, etc but not make reference to the form, box location and whatnot.



I feel like I'm missing out on possible deductions due to this. Deluxe version starts asking about a lot of things with not a ton in the way of explanation. Terms, forms, etc | 90912185|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|675
2 | State Filing I have filed in the past and was able to see immediately didn't have to file state tax return. This year it never showed that I could cancel my filing.

1 | Dishonest product; garbage service Every year I get tricked into using Turbo Tax by my own desire to not do taxes. This year, I wanted to claim the American Opportunity tax credit for the first time. According to the documents in the TurboTax knowledge base (and in the IRS's documentation), I should've received ~$900 more than TurboTax decided. I wasted a half dozen hours between an initial attempt to rectify last years' return and this year's attempt to get them to rectify my deduction. Their customer service is inept and designed to frustrate. I will actively recommend against this product at any opportunity.

3 | TurboTax funky pricing games are DISLIKED 3 times over the last 13 years I have decided to give TurboTax a try again. They are the most luxurious and expensive, which is okay because ease of use is superb. Then each time, there is some quirk in pricing, promotion, extra health care forms forcing you to a higher plan, etc. This year, even as the representative did the online remote screen help (which is a luxury feature) they admitted the were unsure why pricing came out the way it did. They called billing, they didn't know. Billing and representative both couldn't explain pricing error and it took 56 minutes of phone call to get a "service code" issued to try to correct pricing. When 2 employees and one customer think the pricing is wrong, it means your PRICING / PROMO GAMES are doing a lot of ill will, taking up a lot of time, and leading me to look elsewhere. :( TaxAct is very straight forward in pricing/promos, it makes them easier to trust.

By the time I sent my e-file, the Turbo Tax fee was over $214....For that much I can have a professional bookkeeper do it and not have to fuss with it at all.

1 | Did not import previous year's data I've used the online version of Turbo Tax for YEARS (and the PC version prior). My taxes are not complicated - I could do them fairly quickly without paying for TurboTax Deluxe; however, the import from previous year's return feature and storing previous returns where I can find them is worth the fee. 



This year, the import did not work, so I had to type in all the carry over information that should have automatically been brought over. I know I used the correct username because I was able to pull up my 2015 return that I had to use for reference because the import failed. 



Also, it was PAINFULLY slow to type in my W2 - tabbing or clicking to the next field moved the cursor, but it was hit or miss whether or not any of the numbers I typed would enter in the field. Something that should have taken a couple of minutes took almost 15 minutes.



To the Intuit team: Poorly written and buggy updates to Quicken made me drop your other consumer product a few years back. I will download and print all of my previous returns, and you can delete my data because I will NOT be coming back.

Never liked dealing with Inuit but Turbo Tax was cheaper than an accountant so I suffered through the poor programming and shady user policies. I'm no longer convinced that TurboTax is maximizing my return and saving me money (once I factor in my time).

1 | Disappointed My husband and I have used Turbo Tax for several years. Many other tax software has been made available over the past few years but we remained loyal customers of Turbo Tax. This year it was discovered that we had automatically been switched to the "premiere" version and had to pay to file our federal taxes, which is free everywhere else, or start our taxes all over again. On top of that, I had to wait for over 40 minutes to speak to a human on the phone to try to resolve the issue with no results. Sorry Turbo Tax, we will not be using your software ever again.

2 | Lack of support NEEDS WORK

I couldn't enter a number is the real estate taxes field. Felt like it was grayed out but it wasn't. TOTALLY FRUSTRATED! Called for support and was told it would cost me. Interestingly, the IRS now does the same thing for Deductions. Well the interesting thing is i just had to double click the box. There was no indication of this at all! This happened again later at a different point but a double click didn't help. This time the solution was to be spoon fed the questions.

Their sample K-1s are available for anyone on line. So why didn't Turbo Tax use that as a template and give it's 1000's of users a template model to follow. I wasted over 7 hours and finally called telephone support. Support was great it only took about an hour with screen sharing to reenter all of my k-1 and get through the errors.

1 | Not happy with this version of turbotax. In previous years I have been able to edit all areas of the form to get a much done with the information that was available, then go back to edit the information to complete the tax return with accurate information at a later time. Now I will have to amend my return after it is filed and accepted. Couldn't fill out all the information readily available, then go back to edit areas like W2 forms at a later time. | 90910982|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|738
2 | constantly recalculating painful experience The new version of Turbo tax seems to have a lot of add ons to deal with changes in tax law. As a result it is painfully slow.



It is nice that it does do the tax return, however it makes my computer feel like it is from 1978. Way to slow, gets stuck in a loop re-calculating refund/amount owed | 90910972|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|739
2 | Glitches p me off. At this point your program should run more smoothly. It tells me there is a problem before filing about a date. I have no idea what it is talking about because 1/1/2016 -12/31/2016 is not 366 days. Yet it won't allow me to change the date and even if the date is wrong, I should have been able to efile anyway. This happened with another part of the program to which just had me going around in circles back and forth between two screens because it wouldn't let me advanced. Really annoying. Now I have to mail my taxes on 4/18/2016 at 9:35 pm. Really ticked off. will not let me correct problems and thus could not e-file. | 90910969|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|740
1 | Turbo TAX the GODFATHER of tax returns Bait and switch on pricing you should be ashamed. Will be my last yr with Turbo Tax. I do no recommend. Start my return shows price of 29.99 for state. Get going almost finished and fed is $94.99 and state is now 39.99. It's late (4am) and I decide to go to bed and finish up later that day. Now it 114.99 and 39.99. So i'm done. $166.19 now. at an expensive price also don't like the fact turbo tax conned me out of $30. | 90910964|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|741

I just get upset when I can buy the program for under $50 and then be charged $25 to file a state return (fed return is included in the price). I would prefer they add the $25 to the price of the product and let me decide if it is worth it before I buy. I will look at the completion next year to see if they offer a better deal. Charging $25 to file state tax is a rip-off..Tell me up front | 90910889|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|745
1 | hidden fees I don't recall this happening in the past, but I was super upset when I purchased the software this year (which I don't agree with in the first place, paying for a new disc every year) and at the very last step I was charged again another $25 to file! This is completely unacceptable if you ask me. If I could have I would have returned the disc. I will not be using the software anylonger after using it for the last few years. get charged for the disc, and then again to file!!!! | 90910880|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|746
1 | Paying State filing fee by CC DID NOT WORK While I choose to file my taxes on 4/18/2017 @ 9:28 BY CHOICE, since I owed State taxes, Turbo Tax's system told me that it had to save my tax file before I could pay this fee by CC, after saving it brought me to a blank box which I had to X out of. After 9 or attempts, I gave up and paid the $34.99 fee to have the State filing fee deducted from my return. Total rip off; I've used Turbo Tax for the last 10+ years and will be using TAX ACT or similar software next year...never again Turbo Tax.

3 | what happened?? I have been using TurboTax on my Mac for years, but this year the 2016 program was slow and buggy - what happened?? I would have to click to open my file many times before it would actually open. The Advertisement for e-mail updates that pops up every time I opened the program would not minimize or go away until I signed up...not nice!! I really hope that TurboTax doesn't sell my e-mail account and I start getting junk mail. It also took me awhile to figure out that I needed to click through the answers to all of the questions in a form and then click "finished with ..." in order to move between State and Federal forms. Also, clicking on question/answer sentences like: "What if I have a 1095-B from my employer?", did not pop-up in the foreground, and often took awhile to load on the screen. What I liked was the more specific descriptions on what is covered and not covered in specific instances. buggy programming.

3 | Good, but could improve I like TurboTax in general, but the interface used to be better in the past (or maybe my situation got more complicated over the years). What bothered me this year were these two issues:



1- There was a form, 2210, (unusual circumstance: had to pay penalties for under-payment), and I had initially entered the wrong number Line D-1. It was impossible to edit that one field and I had to redo the whole set of questions to fill the form from scratch.



A corollary to that point is that when TurboTax says "Line D-1", it is not clear which one exactly it is referring to. There are multiple Part D's on the form.



2- TurboTax offers to help me fill a state specific form (Minnesota property tax refund), but doesn't save it in my return. When filling this year's form, it asks for Line 12 of last year's form, but since it does not save that form, I have no way of knowing what value I should use because I no longer have access to that form. I have to call the MN Dept of Rev to ask them find my file and let me know what the value on Line 12 was.



Don't get me wrong, I like TurboTax and it's probably better than other tax software out there, but I'd like to see it improve. Fields in specific forms cannot be edited if erroneously entered | 90910631|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|759
3 | Surprise Fee Turbo Tax has been my go to program but this year will no doubt be my last. I spent over $200 just to complete and pay my taxes before I even paid my tax bill.

3 |  The prospect of filing US taxes so complicated that only the most intense QA effort will bring the software and customer support process will achieve acceptability. I think that true excellence is probably not in the cards. A single challenge in the application or customer support can magnify a customers frustration because of the intense and sustained effort which is required. Unfortunately, the tax preparation industry seems intent on keeping the requirements complicated to support their industry. But taxpayers in other countries don't have to go through this. Home stretch is excrutiating | 90910588|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|763

I use turbo tax to pay my taxes and i pay you guys to get it right... and i appreciate it. But to not make it possible to either get help / ask a question is a rip off.

2 | Major flaws in software 1. After 6 hours of trying to transfer data from my last (2015) return to an "online" (supposedly free one) I gave up and called Turbotax. After 2 CS reps called me (the second one literally hung up on me as I don't think she understood what the issue was (I wasn't being obnoxious). The next day I called again and an hour later a CS rep called and said I would have to use the same way I used last year and I cannot get a downgraded version (even if I didn't need it this year) if had used a download/cd method. I said there's the first problem it doesn't say what "download/CD" means. Does it mean an instant download is available if you elect that or do I have to wait 3 days for the CD to download it from there. Also if it is a download form the Internet why do they have "Online" as an option too? (no explanation given anywhere on that - the trouble is if you are about to pay $89 I want to know if I have to wait three days or not) Also, Instead of starting off with free version and get locked out (until you have to cough up money to get what you need) The very first thing Turbotax should say is IF YOU WANT TO TRANSFER YOUR DATA FROM LAST YEAR YOU HAVE TO USE THE SAME METHOD YOU USED LAST YEAR AGAIN THIS YEAR (which means you have to cough up the same amount you spent last year (i.e., $89 in my case). So you can't use the free "Online method to get data from a "download" file. It said I could use the PLUS or DELUXE version to transfer data. Not! I tried that and it only gave me the premier option. Anyhow the CS rep finally managed to transfer the data (after I pad $89).

Second HUGE problem is that you cannot see what you are filing to th eIRS. There is no preview. In the preview it shows the Audit Defense form. I thought will the IRS see that form? I called Turbotax and the CS rep (nice) said apparently the right forms will be sent but there is no way (yet) of seeing which ones the IRS gets!!!!!! MASSIVE PROBLEM THERE TURBOTAX. That is a very very basic thing that should be available, especially when it is being sent off to the IRS. I said to the CS rep that I hope she is right and the IRS won't see a form saying "Thank you for paying for your audit defense".



Also, this "free" as a starting point is an absolute disaster. When I come to that time of the year I don't want to mess around. I know it won't be free, so I just want to be able to get my taxes done as quickly as possible. This year was the hardest its ever been to get started (I wasted about 6-9hours trying to load up the data. Please let the software developer Chief call me because Turbotax has mounting problems.

Also, I could only buy a CD version in the shops. Why not a stick version with eh DVD version? (as my Macbook pro does not have a CD/DVD drive).

By the way your Terms and Conditions make me feel like the guy who was dragged off the United jet. (when I am the guy who is trying to help you and giving you my time to do it for free) 1. Took 6hrs+ to get Turbotax to transfer tax info from my 2015 return. 2. It does not let you see what you are e-filing | 90910464|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|768

2 | Taxes I have been using Turbo tax since 2011 when I started doing taxes, and every year that I do them I have no access to the previous years tax returns. Every year your program says that it will keep my returns on file and every year I cant find the previous years returns. The only reason I can look at my returns is because I learned from my first 2 years of not being able to retrieve my old returns to start saving it to my computer.

NO MORE! I'm taking them to a professional next year as it no longer is worth my time to do all of this for this amount of money. You have just priced yourself out of customer.

It was not this way last year, and I don't recall being informed that this would happen at any time in the process. Atop this, the option to pay out of my federal refund cost an additional $35, which I was not informed of until well after I had selected that option. All in all, I paid $65 out of my return to keep my $10 state tax return. Likely will not be using the same software again next year.

3 | Ttax premere Corrupted my 2016 Return I've been using Turbotax before it ran on Windows (used DOS). So this year, during one of it updates, it completely corrupted my tax return. I called Intuit, and even though they were nice, they didn't have an answer for me. Luckily I had a Time Machine backup, and only lost a couple of hours of work. corrupted my file | 90910029|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|789

2 | It's Probably Time to Hire a CPA I've used turbotax for over 11 years. Except for some salary increases, our returns have stayed pretty consistent over the years (MFJ, 0 dependents, rent, not self-employed, etc.). This is the 3rd year we've owed taxes after completing our tax return with the online software. I also had to manually look up information from previous returns to file this year's taxes. I'm not 100% confident that TurboTax helped me minimize my tax obligation over the years. I also did not receive any recommendations to help plan for next year.

3 | Fed filing is great State is horrible I would not recommend this service for student filers. I had my dad help me file my taxes for the first time this year. I am a student and did not make much last year but had to file. Turbo Tax charged me more than twice the amount I will be getting back from Federal and State combined. I will not be using this service again! Cost of filing for students | 90909965|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|793

3 | Difficult to mail state after Fed e-file After using the free Federal e-filing feature of Turbo Tax Deluxe it is too difficult to figure out how to manually print and mail the state return. I finally figured it out but it is not very intuitive. Could it be that Intuit does this intentionally to force more users to pay $25 to e-file the state return? They certainly made that option a lot easier. If so, this is a poor and unfair decision by product management. State print and mail filing too difficult if Fed e-filed | 90909935|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|796

Makes me consider spending many times more and pay someone just so I don't have to use this software! It seems like it should be getting better by year not worse!!!

3 | GA State return subject to error The entry for the GA state 529 deduction needs to be handled better. It relies on YOU to determine the deductible portion of your 529 contributions. There is no check or validation steps for this in the program, but there should be. I entered the entire contribution amount for 3 children incorrectly and it passed all turbotax error checking. It should ask for the total contribution PER CHILD, then the software should determine the deductible amount using the current year threshold... prone to error | 90909875|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|801
2 | Improvements It would be better if the program allowed for two or three state preparations and then left no surprise at the end for MORE FEES. The IRS form was E-filed without a hassle, however, The KANSAS forms where the TAX was ZERO was to be charged an additional $34,99 to E-File, not real COOL you guys. I mailed in the state returns because of the negative impact given the cost of doing so with your program.

2 | meh I went to the much more expensive Turbo Tax over Tax Act in the hopes of getting a more clear and straightforward way of filing 2 "married filing separate" returns in a community property state. It was a little more clear but no where near as clear as I hoped. They really should consider a version where you can but in the information once and it automatically generates 2 returns with incomes/deductions properly split between the two spouses.

In addition there was false advertising with the price of the state efile... it clearly said $20 per state return but once I bought the software it said $25. expensive, deceptive price advertising, married filing separate was still confusing | 90909823|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|804
2 | Troublesome Couldn't move around. Couldn't print forms easily. Couldn't find certain forms. It is just not up the standards of the past. It was a study in confusion.

2 | Amended Return Headache I've used TurboTax for years and never really had any problems. This year I thought I might need to Amend a return (bad idea). After number crunching I realized I did not need to amend my return. And this is where the headache begins... Every time I tried to go through review process I would select I do NOT want to amend my return and EVERY time I kept getting a message towards end of review that I had to EXPLAIN THE REASON FOR AMENDED RETURN. I even went in and deleted the 1040X form and still got the same message every time. I submitted a message for TurboTax to contact me because in addition to Amend issue, I could not E-File my return (I have always been able to E-file). I was supposed to hear from a rep within estimated 20 minutes. That was over 40 minutes ago. I somehow managed to get to E-file screen about 5 minutes ago, but I have no idea if transmission will be accepted and whether or not my refund will be direct deposited or mailed to me. This was another buggy issue that occurred. A couple of hours ago I could select direct deposit, but in the last few tries I kept getting a message saying my refund must be mailed to me! My state return was TINY and the fee charged for state return was almost 1/4 of my refund. Not cool :( Must be a bug with software | 90909658|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|813
3 | Paid Extra I don't like how I'm not self-employed anymore (I was the previous year) and it made me pay a self employed fee. I couldn't take it off. That was extra money I didn't have. To me that is very tricky and underhanded.  | 90909643|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|814

3 | Business Expense section is buggy Couldn't enter individual business expenses. Guide Me interface never took me to the part where it added them as expenses instead of assets.

3 | Turbo Tax gets worse every year The ability to adjust Federal Tax Data for the California State return did not function properly and made it impossible for me to make required adjustments.

1 | Terrible. Will never use again. "Free" they say. File your taxes for free with turbotax. Until you fill out all the information and they want an additional $30 to file your state taxes with your federal.

As someone who lives paycheck to paycheck and already has to pay their horrible state tax money I don't even have, that $30 will break me.

On top of that, because I knew I would have to pay money I don't have, I put off filing them til the deadline. What Turbotax didn't tell me is that they can't even actually file my state taxes and I have to mail them in with a check for what I owe. So I'm not even sure what the flip I just paid $30 for. Pretty sure I just got scammed.

Despicable business practice.

I would recommend going to a professional. It might cost twice as much, but at least they would actually help you and not screw you over like turbo tax. If I get charged a fee for sending in the hard copy of my state return a day late, Turbotax will be paying it, not me.

2 | Easy enough but hidden fees Turbotax makes filing your taxes pretty simple with it's auto import of W-2s and assistance throughout the process. Although beware the advertised price is NOT what you will pay. Each state tax filing fee added exponentially adds to the final charges and beware to pay with your return is another charge. Turbotax kept automatically adding the premium service after I repeatedly said no so just beware this site will try to get it's money's worth out of you. Furthermore, I am a USAA member and I was NOT given the advertised $20 discount because I filed on my laptop and not on a desktop (what is that about!?). But other than that it makes the filing process streamlined and simple to use, just beware of the added charges which make this site about as much as just having someone file them for you would charge.

I had to PAY to file to my "free state" and then I can't pay my taxes due to my "free state" using TurboTax. I have to go to the state's website to pay the taxes. 

1) I had to pay my federal taxes due using a bank account since there's extra fees for using credit cards

2) I had to pay TurboTax to file my "free state." Unbelievable!

3) I had to go to the state's website to enter my bank account info again to pay my state taxes due.

1 | Mis-calculated and tripled my 1099-int income After entering my 1099-int income information, the system calculated the total interest amount to be about $16,000. I didn't give too much thought to it. As I was getting read to file, the system didn't report any error. Then I noticed on the PDF that some of the 1099-int were duplicated. I went back and deleted them all. But the system was still showing more than $8,000 1099-int income. After conferring with the support team, they concluded it was a technical issue and suggested deleting Schedule B. It worked in zeroing out 1099-int and fixing the issue. But if technical issues like this exist and there is no safeguards to detect them, I could have paid thousands of dollars in extra tax and without knowing it.

1 | Poor Customer Service I had an extremely negative experience in uploading Turbo Tax to my computer and dealing with customer support. I bought the 2016 Deluxe program from Costco (I also did this in 2015). My laptop doesn't have a disk drive - so I called the customer support # to push the product to my computer online. I did this in 2015 -- it took longer than expected, but it worked. This year, I called at 4:30pm and was told that there was an average of a 29 minute wait - I left my number to be called back. I didn't receive a call back until around 45 minutes later. The girl confirmed my identity/information (after returning and asking additional questions) - I gave her the code on the back of the cd I'd purchased, and she said she would send it and I could find it under downloads. I logged into my account and it wasn't appearing under downloads (this is around 30 minutes into the actual conversation with her). We figured out that I had multiple user names associated with TurboTax (this is something that should be flagged so that individuals don't accidentally create numerous accounts). I logged into the correct account - and it still hadn't appeared under my account -- and downloads. The only download I saw there was the one from 2015. She kept telling me that she had sent it - and didn't understand why it was not showing. She made me feel like it was my error, when she asked if I could see "xyz" even though I'd described the area that I was at - the correct area for downloading the program - since I'd also gone through this process in 2015. She put me on and off of hold multiple times and kept asking me if I saw the download -- I was patient at first, and then became frustrated, and asked if there was a code, or work around - some easy way that she could push the product to me online - or I could at least download the product for free with a code - since I'd clearly already purchased it. Needless to say, she kept putting me on and off hold - until finally I was put on hold for longer than normal - the phone beeped and went dead. She failed to call me back. At this point I had been on the phone with her for 1 hour & 3 minutes (none of that was wait time, this is once I received a call back). I have a screen shot of this. I was in tears at this point. It was unbelievable to me that since she was struggling, she wouldn't have reached out to her manager, or someone else who could have simplified the process for her. AND she failed to call me back. Considering the fact that she confirmed my phone number, and had full access to my account I know she had access to my contact information, and SHOULD have called me back. It was incredibly rude, disheartening, and honestly made taxes the worst they've ever been. I was sobbing by the end of it. 



I buy Turbo Tax because it's supposed to simplify the process. Not become a nightmare of back and forth on the phone continually telling the individual the download is not there and them telling me "it should be" and not understanding why I'm not getting it. I ended up going to Best Buy and buying a cd drive to plug into my computer so I wouldn't have to deal with the awful Customer Service for a 2nd time. I have been a loyal Turbo Tax customer since 2012, but this experience has tarnished my faith in the company and desire to continue using Turbo Tax.



It would be nice if someone would reach out to discuss this further, as I'm still quite upset by the matter. Incredibly disappointing, given how positive the experience has always been with the actual tool.



On a side note, it also bothers me that I paid for a tool that is supposed to include Federal and State Returns, yet to "e-file" for my state return, I paid an additional 24.99 -- even though the box itself says it's 19.99 for state e-returns. That cost should be included and the tool itself is misleading as a result. -poor customer service; misleading in cost of Turbo Tax - paid for it at Costco, but then had to pay 24.99 for state ref | 90908602|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|845
1 | First time user - disappointed 1) Being forced into Deluxe plan because I had minor dividends.



2) Charging an extra $40 (at the very end) to include filing the state taxes



3) Charging a 2.49% credit card convenience fee (at the very end)

The fees you charge.....especially the unexpected $34.95....is infuriating. But, I guess, if I have to lose approx $200 to get $1000, I have to do it. Sad place we are in. Nearly $200 in fees. $34.95 new & unexpected. Horrible way to run a business | 90908379|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|856
3 | efile charges are nuts! Charges for efiling of state taxes should be drastically less, this is a pure profit item for turbotax. To make it worse the instructions for paper filing of state return and what is needed is not very clear. This should be improved. Finally the charges to deduct filing costs from your refund are completely ludicrous, charge to efile state $24.99 charge to process it from your federal refund $34.99!! just another example of screwing people who are the worse off (those that do not have credit cards etc). this was for my daughters return - bailed out and used my credit card.

2 | Duplicated prop taxes b/w personal and business Not too happy with Turbo Tax this year. Using the wizard, we entered our personal property taxes. When it came time to enter home office business information, we entered our property tax information again, and the % of the house we use for home-office. Turbo tax duplicated the property taxes reported, and instead of reporting $9000 deduction, it was reporting an $18000 deduction! After searching google, I found where a turbo tax rep said to manually remove one of them. I'm lucky I caught this!!! But TurboTax should have handled this without my intervention. Disappointed.

Don't know what happens if you need to subtract from what you originally input. Since I do my taxes over a month or so, very inconvenient. Strange numbers showed up on return that didn't come from me or any calculation, that really bothered me. Did not prompt me to input current IRA totals and this year, I forgot it myself without the prompt. Overall, most unhappy with it this year than any other.

2 | Felt Negatively at the End I was really thrilled at how you have streamlined your product over previous years to do the federal and state tax simultaneously and not have me go through silly sections that won't apply anyway. But when I got to the end, and because I said that I would like to pay my bill with my refund vs my credit card, not realizing there was a huge fee, I felt very badly that TurboTax would try to rip me off after having been a good customer for years. I still feel ripped off at my simple return costing this much. But I know if I went to a "tax store," it would be more. But there was no reason to try to collect almost $40 from me to pay my bill. I think a lot of people would not understand the complexity of this arrangement. I felt like TurboTax tried to bait me. | 90908203|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|867
1 | Hidden FEES & being held "hostage" Turbo Tax did NOT give the discount supposedly offered by my Credit Union!



Instead, there were multiple hidden fees to be able to get my refund sent directly via electronic check to my credit union account.

When I was kind of stuck on a question/response there was no interactive help. You just had to figure it out on your own. The question/answer forum is a joke and you have to dig high and low for a contact number.

3 | Business - not quite like the personal versions I'm a loyal Intuit and TurboTax customer for must be 20 years now. 



The last several of these years, I've become self-employed and have been using TurboTax Business edition for my small business...it's better than spending hours with an accountant, but I'm sorry to say, it's nowhere near as solid as the consumer products. 



As an example, they have you print, sign and scan a signature page for efile before they do a final check on your return. If the check finds any problems that cause you to change anything, you need to repeat that whole print, sign and scan process again since the page has a summary of your taxes. Little things like that make the product feel like it's fighting against you. 



Biggest issue, however, is that the software seems buggy in some spots. 



After spending time getting my balance sheet reconciled, I got all the way through my return before the final check stopped me because two numbers from different forms were out of balance. Turns out that reconciling the balance sheet never went back and carried my changes through the rest of my return, and I ended up needing to almost start from scratch. 



A few other picky things...



As a Mac user, troubles me that TurboTax Business is only available for Windows...every year, I hold my breath that my 2009 copy of Windows will still run. 



The installation process is also pretty cumbersome - it brings in a lot of Microsoft prerequisites, and if you need them, you're in for at least one reboot. 



Anyway, I'm sure it's not a big seller for Intuit, but I'd certainly encourage them to put a few more resources into making TurboTax Business as solid as their consumer products. Not as full-featured as the consumer products | 90908001|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|875
3 | Horrible job with K1 Statements The problem with K1 statements has existed for many years now. One would think that I should be able to simply type in the info from K1 statement into the form in TurboTax and that TurboTax will create, under the hood, all the necessary worksheets and compute the tax. Instead, TurboTax is giving unclear hints how to break a single K1 from a single Partnership company into multiple worksheets. I am still not sure that I have done this correctly even after spending multiple hours trying to get this done right. 

This has been a horrible frustration and waste of time over many years, yet Intuit has not done anything to fix it. It is super difficult to get K1 statements right | 90907991|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|876
1 | unsatisfied The wizard totally skipped a tax break that I had to go searching for to enter after the fact (Form 1098-E). That would have lost me $169. Not happy at all, especially having to pay $29.99. Then I tried to get a 'Live' agent to help me find it, which is promised with the service I purchased, and there is no such thing.

2 | Hidden Charges-Expensive I used to be able to file for FREE. Then, after increased income there was a charge-not too bad. NOW there are fees upon fees tacked on-even a fee for EACH state AND a fee to file AND a fee to obtain protection for filing through TurboTax. Even though I eFiled, I STILL have to send in forms to the IRS-notified at the very end. What's the point if I STILL have to wait for the mail to arrive to the IRS before they will process? Just notify people upfront. It is NOT FREE. Be honest and CHARGE upfront for the software. I'm a travel nurse and work multiple states. VERY expensive!

3 | State Return Issues So...I've gone through the entire process of preparing my return for filing, and TurboTax does everything possible to convince me to spend $24.95 to eFile my state return--which I don't want to do. It efficiently takes me through the Federal e-filing process, but does not automatically take me through the process of preparing my state return for paper filing. I'm still looking for the magic buttons that allow me to print a filing-ready state version of my return. Makes me wonder if this is one last effort to squeeze $24.95 more out of me...I've used TurboTax for at least 15 years, and never had this problem. I now go back to take a fresh look and see if I can figure this out. A (hopefully) final frustration in the filing battle! Last minute charge for E-file; hard to find the non-Efile button to prepare filing-ready document | 90907891|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|881
1 | Not worth it I've never paid this much for tax prep software before ($85 for Fed and State... I'm used to paying about $50-60?). I don't feel like it's worth it for a glorified 1040EZ. Won't be using this again. Too expensive | 90907884|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|882
3 | Tax Time Fun I've been using Turbo Tax for about 8 years or better. I love the fact that I don't have to manually type in my W2 info any longer. I love the help menu when I'm stuck on a question. I will probably continue to use TT for my taxes unless a cheaper alternative comes along. I don't like that TT now charges a fee If you would like to have your return direct deposited. I don't like the cost associated with e-filing either but I guess it beats the price that H & R Block or Jackson Hewitt would charge.

This year (2016) same problem CD wouldn't load, but this time it was impossible to get help on the phone. Online troubleshooting suggested returning the CD which I did. The second CD wouldn't load either but inside the packaging the was a download code. I even tried the CD's on my system at my office, no luck. Next year I'm using a CPA, I don't need the added headache during an already stressful time. Really sad, I've been using TurboTax since the early 1990's.

2 | Hawaii State Tax Problems Retirement Income

Turbo Tax did not recognize that my Federal Pension is not taxable on my State Income Tax Return. 

Added this deduction manually. 

Under “Hawaii Forms” choose “Retirement Wks”

Entered in the “Retirement Exclusion Worksheet” under “Pensions/IRAs NOT Taxable to Hawaii”

Form N-11 Line 13 Pensions taxed Federally but not taxed by Hawaii.

If this is not done, the State Taxes owed will increase dramatically. This question was not asked during the questioning process.



Medical Expenses

Turbo Tax did not enter Medical and dental expenses for the State Tax Return.

The State figures the Medical and Dental expenses differently than the Federal Tax Returns.

This was done on the itemize deductions worksheet A-1 (Itm Ded Wks Res) in Turbo tax. It was not flagged during the questioning process.

2 | Too much money Turbo tax keeps going up and the main thing it saves me is the hassle of math and filling out the forms by hand. It doesn't really help me get anything beyond the basic deductions and I spend $85 dollars. I tired buying it at Costco two years ago and still had to pay for state.

3 | A money pit My poor daughter had to pay Turbotax $135 for a Self-Employment and NY state filing. Her tax situation was very simple but she was "forced" into the Self Employed version because of her 1099-MISC which she received for a measly $415 for a one-time gig (just barely over the minimum required). And now she had to go through all the itemization tests - a few hours' worth of work and looking up information. Had there been a question up front asking if she thought she might have deductions over the standard amount, we would not have gone through the tedious task of pulling information for donations, student loan repayments, etc. etc. What a headache - only to find that the Std Deduction was the right way to go.

It is sad that she had to fork up such a huge portion of her refund to TurboTax, and almost every step of the way, TT was putting out recommendations to upgrade to something or other thing. This was a very frustrating experience for her and for me, the tax preparer. That said, TT works very well for us (parents) due to the large number of forms we have to pull together for our tax returns. Cheaper than paying someone, so we made out.

2 | Lots O' Struggle This year I moved once and rolled a 401(k) into a Roth IRA. Apparently this made my taxes complicated enough that it cost me close to $100 and took me over five hours total to file: figuring out how to account for my conversion (because TurboTax didn't do it, despite having access to all my files through my financial advisory company), conducting manual checks to ensure that all my data had been appropriately entered because I couldn't figure out where to see it reflected, and begging TT to accept the address on my credit card (the same credit card I use everywhere else...). Plus I got slammed by a bunch of additional fees after I'd already done the work and was not made aware of the fact that I had access to additional resources during the preparation that I was being charged for. There's a very good chance I'll just opt to pay someone to do my taxes next year, because despite good experiences in the past, this year with TT was a nightmare. hard to find specific filing issues | 90907553|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|897

2 | Incomplete Interview Note: As I did last year (2015 Taxes) I am using Turbo Tax Premiere (Ha!)

1. As both my wife and I are Military retirees living in Ohio, all of that retirement income is exempt from OH Income taxes. During the upfront "interview" process, Turbo Tax never asked if we had military retirement income which, not Federally but in Ohio, substantially reduces our state income tax obligation.

2. Also, again in Ohio, premiums I paid toward Long-term Care Insurance are deductible (in Federal they are only deductible against self-employment income). I had to go find this information and IT 1040 Schedule A in Turbo Tax because I was not presented with that form nor the options to make those credit claims against my income.

3. Anyone who has received and processed Schedules K-1 knows they are not easy to process (particularly as it pertains to Foreign Taxes Paid). Last year in 2015 Turbo Tax I was able to import three Sched K-1s without issue (after review, everything worked as advertised). This year, Turbo Tax made the process even harder than it would have been had I used a pencil and paper tax forms. It did not import all the information available in the downloaded K-1s causing me to manually enter the information and trying to figure out where all of it was supposed to go in my return. PAINFUL!!!

Note: I had the same issue with Foreign Taxes from my brokerage account, so it is probably more related to the Form 1116 and its associated worksheet than the import of the K-1 data.

Paying extra for Premiere in order to accommodate not-typical tax situations seems logical...if only it worked as it should have. Would have cost me $1,800 had I not been aware of certain OH tax cedits | 90907495|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|900

1 | created errors and unable to fix I'm unhappy with the online version that I used, and because my wife's part time employer paid her and provided a 1099, we were forced to use the "self-employed" version, adding extra cost, created errors that were impossible to find and fix, and when I called in today to get "expert" help, the rep said he had to escalate it, and then promptly disconnected the call.

1 | Hidden Fees I got through my entire return only at the end to see they had added premium services at 39.99 I absolutely at no time clicked to add.

1 | TurboTax needs to go out of business I have no idea who the audience for this review is, but in the hopes that it will be publicly available, I would like to direct the reader's attention to the following sources of information: 



NPR and Freakonomics both reported on Joseph Bankman, a Stanford professor who attempted to get the state of California to change the way that taxes are filed. If you think about it, they already have most of the info needed to calculate your taxes. To paraphrase the host, if Visa or MasterCard expected you to keep track of your purchases and file every year with all the details to pay your bill, we would all go crazy. 



In many other countries, you get a bill from the government, which you are free to alter, and you pay it - no muss, no fuss. If you want to pay someone to go through it, have at it. But these companies, and tax preparers, are siphoning off *billions* of dollars that only add churn to the system. 



To make matters worse, Intuit spends millions lobbying Congress to maintain the status quo. 



Anyway, check it out for yourself, here:

3 | Very good, but I find it expensive I've been using TurboTax for 7 to 10 years. I file two Schedule C, itemize and get Education Credits. I filed tow state returns. I paid $175 this year and, given that I went to other programs for my adult children's returns and for those of my sister's, it seems not price competitive any more. The hook is that they have all your info. Next year may be first venture outside TurboTax for my own returns. Seems to have gotten pricey | 90907297|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|906

1 | Intuit is bad for consumers and taxpayers For years, Intuit has fought against legislation that would literally make it possible to file a tax return on a post card. 



The Feds and states already receive income information; for a plurality of people that is all that is necessary to calculate taxes.



For those with more complex situations, a few additional entries are all that would be required. Too expensive | 90907162|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|910

I also attempted four times to contact customer service. Twice I reached them, twice I was transferred to the tax specialist department, twice I had to wait another hour for a call back.

3 | Turbotax does not show "Calculations" Several problems with turbotax

1) it only shows you the result, but does not show you how the numbers were calculated. It would be better to show the steps



2) when selling rental houses, turbotax confused "sales price" with "sales price minus land value"



3) does not handle non-deductible IRA well does not show how numbers were calculated | 90906978|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|915

2 | 1099 for Rental Property/online upgrade horrible! Problem 1) Premier advertises to handle rentals. But if you need a 1099 to contractor over $600 (not hard to do!) You have to have home and business. This is misleading. 2)I bought premier--wanted to upgrade and not buy new program $139---took 3 days, 2 calls to customer service with online reports filed to resolve the "lock out" due to resetting password in order to GET the $10 upgrade. Customer service people nice--but could not confirm the problem would be resolved. Told me to try again in 15 minutes. After 2nd call--and another 15 minute--I tried again the next day and got it. Either follow up on the calls or keep people on the line until "lock out" reset issue is resolved. and 2) just include the darn 1099 so when you answer the prompt you can complete the form. I have used turbo tax for 8 years--this year spent so much time dealing with this--behind on the rest of the tax file. Ughh. 3 day hassle of not making any progress! | 90906863|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|918
2 | Laughingly Poor Planning by Intuit Do you have QB Windows? And, do you have Turbo Tax Windows? Isn't nice how you can upload your QB data into TT?



I recently switched to QB Mac and TT Mac. Guess what? YOU CANNOT UPLOAD QB MAC TO TT MAC. The program thinks you can...and asks for a TXF file...but even though TT asks for it...QB cannot create it and export it. After 2 1/2 hours with both QB and TT over 2 days (one employee even laughing and apologizing and expressing embarrassment), I gave up. Keep in mind, BOTH these products are made by Intuit. Intuit was zero help. Its online area addresses the issue for Windows but ignores the Mac issue. One person even ventured a guess that with new versions coming out every 12 months...Intuit has ZERO incentive to code good product because it'll be obsolete in a matter of months. Sad.



So, yes, of course I got a full refund. But what a pain in the a**. usefulness is increasingly suspect | 90906831|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|919
2 | Tax Year 2016 filing Turbo Tax does basics well, Transferring data from last year is a plus that makes it hard to leave. Download of 1099 from broker worked seamlessly. Although when I tried to verify data it was almost impossible to find transactions. 1099B data did not appear to have any structure to it. Trying to check the data back to broker's 1099 was very difficult. Also took a while to find transactions where the cost basis needed to be entered. Last year the data was sorted by the IRS categories. May give another program a try next year. Expensive - Almost impossible to find investment transaction | 90906798|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|920

3 | Generally Reliable but... Overall TT has always worked pretty reliably but this years seems really buggy. Not only could I not get past the screen asking for drivers license info (I figured a way around that). 

But when I tried to use a credit card to pay the filling charge for state (and thereby avoiding the TT filing fee (or whatever it was called)), TT melted down and my new hp laptop w/windows 10 was completely hung. It requiring several complete cold starts to get the machine back. I've had this machine for 6-8 months now and NEVER have I had an app break anything like TT seems to have. The only way I could make it work was to pay the extra $34.99 from my refund. ONLY THEN would it finish the filing. (at least I hope it did...we will see). I have been a loyal TT customer for almost 20 years but come next tax season, I am going to look at the other products out there. Some "CHOICES" not real | 90906684|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|923
1 | Dissapointed I regret using turbo tax for my taxes this year. Turbo Tax did literally nothing for me but use the standard deductible. 

Not knowing much about taxes I went and bought turbo tax deluxe as it is one of the only programs to support W2G's. I trusted that turbo tax would find creative ways to lower the impact of the W2G on my tax returns. 

I was sadly Mistaken. Not only did they accomplish nothing but I ended up paying them $70 for merely applying a standard deductible that I could easily have done myself.

My mistake of buying this program was only made worse when I discovered the 'free' state I received with my $45 software, was not really free. With the Download being free, but the filing costing $25. Keep in mind this amount cannot be subtracted from your state refunds. And a $35 fee applies to subtraction from your federal refund. 

Charging fees is understandable, it is a business after all. But deceptively applying fees and 

preying on consumer's misunderstandings of the tax system and computer technicalities are not understandable.

Furthermore, when trying to contact the company to understand my fees and program capabilities, there is no easily accessed support. No chat, no phone. Just a simple forum and a "help others yourself" (a fancy way of saying forum) option. If you really do your research you can find the phone, but odds are you will be conveniently disconnected before you even get to talk.

If I ever use a tax help program again, I am sure to never use Turbo Tax. It is unfortunate that their management has ruined a good product. H&R Block or some other company will merit my attention in the future, I am almost certian my experience with them will be better than this. Hidden costs, No real recourse for help, deceptive titles, and paywalls for simple forms (W2G) | 90906661|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|924
2 | Cost CLEARLY up front You need to explain the cost a little more clearly - and at the beginning.

I thought it was 45 for the max with doing the deluxe, not an extra 45!



You also waited till the end to tell me

I needed to have my AGI IRS code.....so while I was expecting to e-file, I now have to mail it. I was a little shocked to see a $135 price tag at the end | 90906657|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|925

1 | Section for dispositon of MLP First, your assistance board list 2 conflicting methods for disposition of a MLP with the sale is also listed on an imported 1099-B. Both methods do not work well. 



Turbotax needs to rewrite the program so that disposition of MLP is handled so that 1099B data is not duplicated.



Second, there is little assistance on entering Proper values for a MLP sales schedule. It is easy to make errors.



Third. Your MLP sales area does not handle sales separated into LT and ST sales. You must pick one or the other which is erroneous.



In sort, you MLP disposition procedure causes multiple errors and is a poor reflection on turbotax. Lack of information-conflicting information | 90906594|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|927
1 | Wouldn't allow discount I tried multiple times to use Fidelity, Vanguard, and Ebates $20 coupon but your system would not allow. I have used Turbotax for several years but this is my last. Failed to provide valid discount | 90906593|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|928
3 |  I have filed my taxes with TT for several years. I found that several of this year's prompters and explanations were inadequate and, in some cases, misleading. More effort to be clear even if you have to add a few words or sentence. I appreciate you are trying to be succinct, but .... I was disappointed enough with the 2016 directed walk through portion that i may consider another product for 2017. | 90906590|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|929

1 | Wary of changes to packages Hate the fact that you cannot go straight to the forms and enter data after paying the fee to TT.

3 | disappointed this year Somehow a phantom S Corp showed up in the program and I was unable to delete it, even after following the 'help' instructions. That meant I had to mail the returns, but the post offices were closed!! Not good! And no apparent way to get live help. Turbo Tax is usually flawless, but there appeared to be several people who had the same problem. phantom S Corp-couldn't delete | 90906134|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|939
1 | Going in the Wrong Direction. I've been using TTAX for over 12 years and this is the worst version I've ever encountered. I spent hours trying to find the 1099R forms and when found they were quite unfamiliar. I struggled the whole way through the process. Sometimes change is a good thing, but not in your case. You had a beautiful program that was relatively user friendly and have serially destroyed it. I'll be looking for another Tax program next year and I'm not happy about that. When your profits start to fall, I hope you'll

remember that, at one point, you were untouchable as the #1 program on the market and the reason you failed to hold that position. Certainly this product is far less than I expected from the Intuit organization. Non-intuitive, Needed Forms Hidden | 90906102|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|940
3 | Tool seemed clunky this year The tool does not seem to flow this year. I understand the separation of income and expenses, but things I completed correctly kept coming back as errors. For example I repeatedly was prompted for the date I took my car out of service, but I had not taken my car out of service.



This year I was compelled to do a significant amount of checking on schedule C, and on the AMT, which is always confusing.

Also I miss the analysis that compares my return to others submitted and how much tax I pay compared to others.

I suggest the use of dialog bubbles to assist with explanations. The tax code is legislation after all. Maybe it should include bill sponsors. 

Our tax code is confusing, Turbo tax has made that better, but would like to see more guidance on difficult sections like the AMT. Process did not flow as past years | 90906100|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|941

1 | Nickel and Dimed I've been with turbotax for years now. For the most part, they've been good. Now, this year was the absolute worst though. They seem to be nickel and diming for everything. I spent almost $200 for the self employed version with the state and max protection! 200 hundred! To do my taxes! Last year I spent $60 for the same thing. I'm definitely expanding my options next year. I don't like being taken advantage of like this. No one does. By the way, I tried several nicknames like "horrible", "terrible", etc. for the review title and they were all taken. Seems like people are fed up with turbotax. Way too expensive | 90906006|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|943
1 | After 12 years with Turbo Tax, worst changes ever! Program kept signing me out, no reference info brought over from last year, when fixed rejected issue, the problem kept showing and did not say it was edited, confusing with your continue or back button to move forward, not enough detail about what you can and cannot use for deductions, form 1095A showed incorrect information and unable to correct it at our level---bad feeling about that! You need to include a timeline to tell you how close you are to the end of filing process. Hate your updates, will not likely use you next year. The price increase was gouging and not worth it! no info transfer, price increase, not enough detail with deductions, clumsy with the back and continue | 90905815|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|944

3 | Difficult Bottom line, this was an absolute nightmare. My password did not work. I changed phones, so I could not get updated on the password because everything went to my old phone The automated responses kept sending me to my email, which sent to the phone I no longer had. It took a zillion different attempts to find a live person, finally called intuit's headquarters. When I got the live person, they did not know how to help. I had to figure out how to beat the system to change my phone number, then had to work for hours to figure out how to correct mistakes TurboTax was making on my clergy reporting. If my goal was to learn patience, I get an A+. This year was the hardest year. Could not contact anyone personally. Does not handle clergy well. | 90905602|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|947

However, it charged me extra then I had to pay an additional fee to take it out of my refund which isn't fair at all. I don't know if I will use it again next year. I don't think I should have to pay near 100 for a full time college student not married who doesn't own anything. crazy! more expensive then expected | 90905437|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|950

1 | HORRIBLE ! I just had Turbo Tax change my State filing that resulted in $6000 refund changing to $1100 Tax due.



TT's Error Checker said No Errors, 100% Error Free then in eFile said i needed to change things in order to file. I allowed TT's change and AFTER eFiling noted that the result changed tp Owing $1100 of additional Taxes...

3 | More difficult than last year Carry over on spouse IRA did not carry over.

Could not print parts for review before the end.

Difficult to move from one part to another. There needs to be a "go to" function.

Actual 1040 pages were not available. too simple | 90904789|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|962
2 | 1095-A The "experts" that advise you on removal of the 1095-A sent you down a path that doesn't exist. As a result, I could never delete the 1095-A and kept getting error messages. I was put into an endless loop of errors. Really pathetic for a company that is suppose to be highly ranked. The customer service is lacking.



The result of the that is that I could not efile my Federal Tax return which in turn didn't allow me to file my state return because they had to be done at the same time in spite of the fact I noted I would mail the Federal return. 



I wasted at least five hours trying to figure out this and was unsuccessful.



The stress of April 15th is already there, you don't need additional.

You would be much better served using an accountant. Experts | 90904787|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|963

3 | Great, buy pricey I should have switched to a free service available by other providers for my age & income. I waited too long and couldn't get all the info inputted in time to make the switch. Next year, I will switch unless I can use Turbo Tax for free or perhaps almost free. I could have filed for free elsewhere. Cost to file my business deductions on my 1099-MISC meant I couldn't deduct them. | 90904691|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|965
3 | Ok, seems worse than before Did not appropriately categorize several of my items, and flat-out miscalculated my city tax, resulting in what would have been a large overpayment. After I discovered the error on my own, there was no way to change it. Others told me about glitches and errors with this year's version, but I used it anyway. Now I'm thinking I should go back and have someone recheck my past returns. Got things wrong | 90904643|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|966
3 | Not as good as it was in the past I've been using TT for years since the 90s. I think the cloud version is getting more effort put into it than the CD version. I've noticed a gradual decline on how happy I am when I am done. Can't put a finger on it, but it gets worse each year. I prefer a desktop version over the web, but if that's how it's going to be soon, please let us know. More difficult to work out errors - | 90904626|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|967

1 | efiling nightmare I have used turbotax my entire adult life and always been pleased. I spent the entire day trying to efile and it was rejected everytime even though I confirmed with IRS AGI information was correct. IRS says they never received the filing to reject.

1 |  Selected the free federal with states included option. Another option was free federal, states additional. I know how to read and did not mess these words up. At the end of my return the total came to $60, deal revoked. Do not plan on returning when H&R Block is cheaper and they can do it for me.

1 | The Ultimate Awful I have spent hours trying to appease this beast. It will not let me claim school expenses, sends me in circles and now, even though I know I am getting cheated on my refunds, it will not let me e-file OR paper file, claiming that some of the forms I need are not available...what? Additionally, I had to purchase the DC "state" tax program for yet more money and it does not work. This is a complete rip off. I really want my money back...and reimbursement for the penalties I will incur because I will file late. won't let me e-file or mail file...at midnight I turn into a pumpkin I guess | 90904349|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|975

2 |  The easier your Federal tax form the cheaper it'll be however the the cost to upgrade is reasonable. All information is transferred into State HOWEVER there is about a $30 something cost to file State return therefore if you are not expecting a big return it's really not worth filing State with Federal if the fee outweighs the return or is more than 1/4 of your return. State can be filed on another online company for free cost to file State - sometimes the fee is more than the return | 90904307|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|978
1 | System would not allow state purchase Second year I had trouble with purchase of state. Call was dropped last year and again this year. Will find a better system for filling.

3 | The end of the road I've used TT since it came on the market and overall have been pleased. I did have one issue years ago and was not able to get anyone from TT to assist me, so I'm hoping that this is better. The help sections all throughout are far more user friendly. The ending is really too awful- with the codes that don't work- and the sneaky pricing is also not a good way to end the experience- because what do people recall? The end- and now, no matter how much I enjoyed the improvements I am left with a bad taste in my mouth over an increase in 40$ in price that wasn't on the original cost breakdown and was tricky enough that you had two separate 'read this and sign' documents explaining it. Honestly if I had a little more energy today I would have printed the whole mess and mailed it. Between that and the codes of doom I'm feeling quite annoyed, which is too bad, because overall the experience was fine. The final moments- the situation with the codes required over 15 attempts. It was unacceptable. | 90904288|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|980
1 | Bait and Switch I love how I get the offer for Free software and by the time I have invested 2 hours of my time and entered all my information, Bait and Switch! Almost $99 to submit my taxes. I would've just dropped all my paperwork off at HR Block if I would have known that. Terrible and misleading. Hidden Costs | 90904238|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|981
2 | Too restrictive At a minimum, I would allow a user to select a box when prompted to do so- for example, Form 1116, to link activities. The user is prompted, if they prefer, to link by double clicking a box. FYI- a user cannot double click anything on that screen. Further, I am a CPA, so I pretty much know where to enter data so that it appears on the form as expected. I don't want to be constrained to do only how the interview screens allow- further, explanations are whacked. FYI- estimated payments are NOT UNUSUAL!! Software blows | 90904210|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|982
3 |  Need a phone number for real help!! This was a technical program error on a simple return. Couldn't e-file state return because program wanted returns from states where I had no income. | 90904201|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|983
2 | Disappointed this year Turbotax used to be honest with what they will charge and the services customers will receive. Now they hide random fees in fine print that only come up until the very end, then if try to choose a different option it will erase your entire return and make you start over.

Whats with the $34 charge for using my federal return as payment? Also a surprise at the end. Sick of the tricks. Going to use an honest company next year. Hidden charges | 90904149|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|984
3 | More automation please I filed my dependent son's taxes with TurboTax also. His taxes and mine are dependent on each other. It would be nice to know which to fill in first and it would be nice if TurboTax transferred his information into my return instead of saying things like "Manually enter your dependent's Modified Adjusted Gross Income". That number does not even exist on his return, it has to be calculated. Isn't that what a tax prep application should do? Could be so much better. | 90904093|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|985
2 | Disappointed by hidden fees When I was finished with my first state return, I discovered I'd have to pay $44.99 for a second state return. Then, on the very last screen in the long process of preparing my taxes, I discovered that I'd have to pay an additional $24.99 to file for that additional state. There is no guidance on how to file on my own, so I felt I had no choice by to pay it. I felt robbed. Very disappointing first experience with TurboTax!

3 | some things never change After decades of improvement and refinement there are still some frustrating rough spots. For example:



If I go back and work with a previous area, then go forth again, EasyStep will often ask the same inane questions: for example, how many times should I have to tell it that I DO NOT own a house?



And in the wrap-up section, when it reports errors that needs to be fixed, it lists the IRS form and line numbers, but doesn't tell where to find them (and they had appeared nowhere in the EasyStep process). Why doesn't it link me back to the appropriate EasyStep page?



Then, having found and fixed errors, when I go back to the wrap-up section it gets awfully confused, and the sequence of steps it shows me often make no sense.



I've been using TurboTax for years, and still see these same problems.  | 90904031|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|988
2 | Customer Service Filling out the forms is easy,

Trying to pay by credit card is difficult at best. Trying to talk with a live representative is impossible. Giving phone numbers to talk to CSRS only to be hooked up to an electronic voice which eventually refers you back to the web site is a frustrating and rediculas way to handle customers,



Even your review system is too complicated, Terrible live customer service | 90904010|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|989

3 | Old problems remain, program doesn't evolve I've used TT for years and I pretty much accept it for what it is. Better than doing taxes by hand, but you better know a thing or two or forgetaboutit! My major gripe is the same as it was years ago. TT will let you enter a bunch of stuff only to say at the end: "your not eligible for that deduction based on your AGI". Well why not ask the question in an intelligent way like: Did you have medical expenses in excess of $xxx.00? If yes, enter them for this deduction. If you use a 529B to pay for kids college, you probably got overcharged by TT. Both myself and a friend almost got snookered. Fortunately he looked on the blog and someone else, not TT, had discovered the error and posted the workaround. Then theirs the upselling. Always wanting you to upgrade to a more expensive version. Charging extra to file state returns. Etc. If I knew of a better program and was willing to go through another learning curve, I would not use TT anymore. You have to fool the system into doing them correctly | 90903974|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|992
3 | Turbo Tax should have versions with multi states With having to pay or three additional downloads for three additional states I spent almost as much as a CPA to file my taxes.



It would be nice if there was a version that included up to 5 state downloads since much of the nation now works in multiple states!! Extra states cost was too much | 90903835|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|993
1 | Liars you state us free but at the end you have to pay 54.99 to complete. I will never use again and will post on social media what a scam your site is.

1 | watch out This website adding $34 back in to the final fee for the 24/7 product no matter how many times I deleted it. I had to pay by credit card to make sure I only paid the base $29. This is CRIMINAL. Used it anyway b/c I was mostly done. Every year I remember I didn't like this product last year! Now I'll write it down for myself so I won't be coming back. It's just dishonest.

1 | Be Careful I ordered TurboTax Online Deluxe when it told me I couldn't file my taxes using the Free or Home/Business Editions. I decided that it cost more than I really wanted to pay to fill out a 1040 form so tried to cancel before I e-filed, but was informed that there are no refunds for TurboTax Online. Thanks guys.

When I went back to finish to get my money back, I ended up going through a ton of rigamarole. :( In the past, it has been a piece of cake, but with complexities in life that postpone finishing a year it can become a nightmare. doesn't save unfinished unfiled years for you to finish easily. | 90903621|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|999

2 | Paid more than saved Poor/misleading explanations of upgraded products. Told that Deluxe upgrade would save more on itemized deductions for $45. Didn't save anything. Unknowingly got charged for state return and didn't save anything either. Paid $85 extra for nothing. Don't recommend upgrades.

I cannot obtain my AGI from you all, no matter what I do. I have called at least twice to obtain a copy of my 2015 tax return by resetting my password, only to spin my wheels. As of 2018, I will no longer use your service. Thank you.  | 90903495|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1002
1 | awful! I needed help with a rejected return then when I called, your company gave me zero help on how to even use your software!

I was given the number to call the IRS and deal with it. I called the IRS and they told me to call you on how to use your software because it was a software issue!

I've used you guys for going on 10 years now and never ran into a single issue until this year!

2 | Frustrating Very frustrating when you have to call 5 times when a payment went through on the card issuer's side but not on your side. Spent late nights and long calls with people who weren't sure what to do. On the good side, Phillip in tech support was able to point to a mistake I made which kept me from being able to efile. He was also able to research that transaction that had problems and explain the problem. I used a different card to pay before talking to him. payment not going thru just on your end but not on mine. | 90903407|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1004
2 | Not Thrilled! I ended up paying $120 to do my own taxes. I could have had a professional do it for that. There were fees to file federal taxes, fees to keep my state taxes combined with my federal taxes, and my favorite, fees to pay them out of my return. That's ridiculous! I won't be using Turbotax next year. The filing fees are absurd. | 90903383|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1005
3 | become very expensive I have used turbotax for over 15years I loved that it was inexpensive and easy! Now it cost for every addition you add and each return you do. I use to be able to do my kids and mom on one program for only 50$ and now each cost 30$ plus state were state was free.

1 | Little detail I have been using TurboTax for more than 10-years (Premier on a CD). This year I had received an offer from my insurance (Allstate) agent on a special savings. I chose the Deluxe version and ending up having to reenter all of my data from previous years (never had to before). It also ended up costing me more than the Premier with State on a CD. what a rip off. Didn't download last years data. I had to reenter everything. | 90903343|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1007
1 | TurboTax OverCharged Me The Amount That stated online wasn't amount charged. Now lets see how long it takes to get my refund. They probably assume I won't bother because its only $5 extra. I would expect more from Tax software company  | 90903341|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1008

1 | Waaaaaay too much upselling Look, I get it, intuit has to make a buck, but the constant harassment to upgrade to Deluxe (which I went with) and the various other services on top of that were a bit much. On my own taxes, being stopped between EVERY section to be asked if I wanted to buy more product was beyond ridiculous. I'm already shelling out over $70 for the federal and state filing, and you want to nickel and dime me for $40+ on top of that? Maybe once or twice, fine. The sheet number of requests was beyond ridiculous.



I was helping a coworker file her daughters taxes (18 year old) and it was for a very small amount of money at play. She was asked no less than 8 times to upgrade! She had come in through the state's free filing portal to here. I can safely say she won't be using the service anymore, and neither will I.

3 | Fast filing, but more money is required at the end I normally use Turbo Tax to file my returns and am typically happy with it. I feel they make things easy to understand and I haven't had any filing issues when using them (knock on wood). This time when I filed I noticed the "optional" Premium portion at the end of filing. I attempted to bypass it, but in order for me to file, I had to click the Premium button. I think that's a little deceptive. Don't make it seem like it's an optional program if it's not. You are required to pay for 3 parts. Premium is mandatory but seemed optional at first. | 90903129|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1016
3 | less than clear Still several glaring problems. First, it often skips right past important sections even though I asked to go through step-by-step - I had to go back and search for where to update my home office and where to request estimated tax payments. I know I didn't simply overlook these, because the same thing happened last year.



Second, it lacks a lot of information on how to handle a 401k rollover to a traditional IRA - it doesn't tell you that you don't have to enter info for the new account on a direct transfer or that this doesn't count as receiving a disbursement. It also doesn't tell how how to classify this for Michigan special handling purposes. unclear answers, terrible support, easy to miss sections | 90903058|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1017

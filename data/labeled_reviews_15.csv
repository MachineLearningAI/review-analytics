3 | Phone Friendly Its not okay that you charge for filing state and 39.99 for processing. I'm out 70 additional dollars on top of what yall keep from my return that I don't know about. If I file my state tax refund with TurboTax I shouldn't be charged both. Hidden costs | 64952518|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0

3 | College 529 accts I have two sons in college and both have 529 accounts. I am also in a tax bracket where we don't qualify for any of the new education/college tax credit programs.

Guidance says even where you don't qualify you should record expenses to avoid getting taxed -- well did that, but again little guidance.

So originally it wanted to tax me on $8,500 of the 529 funds that all went to college expenses. Finally I dug in and went through the various worksheets on my own.

Need to improve guidance in this area. Significantly.

Interestingly last year I took H&R Block up on their offer to review, they were equally clueless on how to handle 1099Q's in relation to 1099T's. Very little guidance provided | 64951118|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|2
1 | Overcharged! I only had one opportunity to choose what I wanted to pay and it was $29.99 -- my usual amount. Instead, they billed me for $99 saying I ordered all these extras that I surely did not. They trick you. I have no home or children and to pay $99 for a tax return is ridiculous.

Beware when choosing your payment. You may have to go back and search for the $29.99 packet as it's hidden someplace deep in all the screens. Shame on you, Turbo Tax! You trick people into paying $99 instead of $29.99. | 64947328|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|3

To many add on expenses this year, previously Turbo tax included state filing now extra charge, both for return and to file. Tired of the corporate greed. At this point I'll pay someone local that I can talk to. Nickel and dimed | 64939306|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|9
3 | Dissatisfied In past years I knew very clearly when my filing was complete. It seems you make changes each year and this year my taxes were filed late.

If I had not been asked about it by my wife I would hot have checked today to complete and I am glad I did. Now I will have to pay penalties. I have used your service for about 5 years or so.

1 | caused late filing I thought I had filed my taxes well before the deadline but I came back to investigate why money owed was not deducted from my bank acct only to discover your system had not actually filed my return. Not only did this cause me to file late but also necessitated the use of my credit card which cost an extra $48+



In addition I will probably have to pay a late fee. All because of your ambiguous system for setting up the payment. How could you let a client go through the whole process of filing including processing a payment then not ensure that they were aware the payment didn't process.

I have been saying the same thing for a number of years but Turbotax has been unable, unwilling or just lazy about correcting the problems connected to the use of Form 1116.

1 |  I have used Turbo Tax for the past 10 or more year, I never will again. I first loaded the software about 6 weeks ago and completed about 95 % of the return , saved it . I started to finish the return just before tax day, it asked if I wanted to update the software , agreed , and updated . After that there was nothing at all in the 2015 form , had to start all over again , and none of the data from all the previous years on my computer would transfer . Had to load all the back data manually, it has been a night mare ,never again will I use Turbo Tax. Not at all user friendly as previous years. Bud Green  | 64906728|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|27

2 | It was very confusing The 1st time home buyer repayment was very confusing this time . It was very hard to find. It took me getting rejected 5 times or more and calling the IRS to try to figure out why it was rejecting my tax return.

In result of the rejections I upgraded my pakages to see if it would help and it did'nt so now I am stock with having to pay a extra $129.00 in upgraded turbo tax package fees.

I use my tax refund to pay my house taxes now I have to try to come up with the difference.

3 | Not bad, but annoying flaws 1. I often return to part of my return to review parts of my return, and every time I'm asked "Was this income earned out of the US?" and so on. Why not let me answer it once, and then say, "Has any of this changed?"



2. This year for the first time, I could not click and review entered lists. For example, I entered charitable donations and business expenses which were totaled. Previously I could double click and see the list of what I'd entered. Not always this year!! As near as I could tell from your users forum, I'm not this only one with this problem. UGH!!

2 | What happened to Turbo Tax? Dear Intuit,



I've used Turbo Tax since the 90's. What happened? Where are all the links to IRS publications from the key words & phrases that need clarification. Rental Houses are extremely painful for example- Why do I have to answer the same first 5 questions over and over before I can finally get to an overview of certain types of expense? Please provide an overview of everything with Rental Houses - like you do with the overall income/expenses big picture. Where did all the helpful interpretations go to help explain how I could save taxes as I fill out the forms? I will be exploring your competition next year because I need more helpful links.

3 | Requesting Improvements Foreign Earned Income Tax filing can use improvement - both in federal and state levels. Automated prompts are not all comprehensive and clear. User can be guided better before choosing between Foreign Earned Income Credit or Deduction or Exclusion. There are software glitches in entering dates to qualify for Bona Fide or Physical Presence Tests as well as in entering foreign employer addresses. In my case spouse's foreign employer info got transfered on IT-2 showing up in W-2. And I wasn't able to delete it from W-2 info since it was foreign earned income.

1 | Charged me for extra with no way to undo I had an employer-imposed health savings account. I made no personal contributions to this account but just because it existed I had to upgrade to the deluxe turbo tax. It wasn't until I had chosen to do so that the service revealed I didn't even get any deductions because I had made no contributions. I also had no option to undo the upgrade. So I spent 50 bucks for nothing. When I finally got to selecting my method of refund it would not allow me to receive a check, a prepaid card, or the free efile option. I was forced to pay an additional 34 bucks for a refund processing service I did not want. Thanks TurboTax, my refund is now 100 dollars (sales tax brought the total up) short for literally no reason. I will never use this service again.

2 | Nice, but issues with Personal Business and State Turbo Tax still seems like the best way to prepare taxes for the money. However, for more complex tax returns that offer multiple forms for different sources of income such as 1099 Misc Income, it can be very confusing. Additionally, Turbo Tax has always been a challenge when transferring to a State and one has more complex tax filings. I spend the bulk of my time trying to understand how the Federal return handles the distribution of my income to the different forms and how the State works in general. It would be nice if the program would offer a flowchart to depict how the tax info will be distributed to multiple forms once all the types of tax inputs unique to the preparer are identified. I am not sure what other services are available that would be better. Every year I consider Lacerte, but talk myself into believing that this year Turbo Tax will get it right. What is the definition of insanity - same actions with the hope for a different outcome? Overall it is still better compared to manual completion and filing. Significant time spent on forms TurboTax selects for income (1099 Misc) for Federal; State transfer always a challenge | 64792131|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|37

I had to start over & enter all the data. I have an income of $182K so the data is extensive.

1 | Using Turbo Tax for the wrong reason. I don't have time to right a detailed review. If I did I would research another tax software and never come back!

I use turbo tax for the same reason many people don't want to leave apple phones or change auto insurance - its difficult to change when you don't have the time.

Here are 3 things that really upset me:

1) Late at night I wanted to contact someone or at least leave an email message with my thoughts and problems at the moment. Long story short there did not appear to be anyway to do that - instead I was re-directed to an area where I could "post" my question. I don't have time for facebook garbage, but i did anyway - I failed to highlight my text and copy. Due to some bug it was all lost.

2) Why is it that after using TT for 7 years this year I was not able to import my tax information from fidelity!! The ability to import anything IS THE ONLY REDEEMING QUALITY TT HAS! ITS THE ONLY REASON I USE IT! 3 or for times i was asked if i would like to import my documents and I selected FIDELITY - I was not told I could not, instead it just lead me down the path of manually typing everything in. THIS TOOK HOURS AND IS INFURIATING! Especially when i got turbotax through the fidelity website!

3) why after 7 years is TT still not able to import a w2 from the 8th largest company in the WORLD? GE! Yes i realize you have an app now that lets you take a picture etc. I don't want to mess around with an app for the 1 simple step of a W2 import. Especially when I will not use the app for another year. Hopefully I will never have to use TT again. I dont' know where to start. | 64787405|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|43

3 | just, Ok I can see how mistakes can be made. Some items, like payment made with automatic extensions are so hard to find they can be missed. Also, I did taxes for my parents and with their return there was a requirement for a new PIN every year. There was no added security when I did my taxes using the same Premier package. too easy, some items are hidden, hard to find | 64783818|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|46
2 | Money Hungry This year it seems that TurboTax got a bit money hungry. In previous years i was able to have my info transferred and do my federal and state taxes for free because I didn't make more than x-amount. This year the wanted to charge for everything and I made well below that amount. They were charging $30 for each state tax that need to be done instead of doing the one free one and then charging for each additional one after that, and then they are charging $30 just to pull information for my previous years and when I choose to not use that option, it deleted everything i had do the previous years from their system so I am not able to retrieve it if need be. For a site that you do most of the input yourself, it seems like it gets to be pretty expensive when its all said and done. all the extra charges | 64781541|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|47

1 | Really messed me up This is the last time I use Turbo Tax. I couldn't get my Fed tax to go through on time. I tried sending it on the 15th of April. On the 20th I learned it hadn't gone through. I tried again. On the 22nd it still hadn't gone through. I'm still not sure if it has gone through. I am now trying to send the State tax. I paid the $25. and was told that I need to file both together. It is due on May 1, and now it won't even print!!! Lousy lousy service. Filing is a nightmare | 64767867|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|52
3 | Great and easy returns until 2016 I have used Turbo Tax many times, but not the past few years. I am disappointed with two things. 1. the print is now too light for me to move thru efficiently, taking longer to complete my return. 2. My work has changed and I no longer have much business income (only $10,000 and minimal expenses. But the software repeatedly pushed me to upgrade to Home and Business, even blocking me to complete and file my return, and causing me to miss the tax deadline. I tried in vane to get help from Turbotax to no avail. So I had to go back through the whole return and remove all data regarding my minimal business expenses. 2nd, I thought my return had been transmitted early on Apr. 16, but checked back today only to find out it was not, even though I'd paid for everything and selected electronic transmission. I would have appreciated a notation on the return or email reminder that It had not yet been filed. I checked back today on the status of my refund, and was shocked that I Had no actual filing verification, rendering me almost 20 days late. All of this is leading me to switch to the HR Block tax prep software system. TurboTax seems to place too much emphasis on selling higher priced software, and less emphasis on insuring that a return is actually completed, once the fees are paid. The guidance for me to upgrade to H & B was too strong -- wasted time, missed filing deadliine. | 64758771|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|53
2 | Used to be better You advertise a free federal return but then you just keep on trying to up the ante and say you have to upgrade because of this or that and it isn't right. For my sons return it ended up costing over $140 which is much more then it would have been if I had just bought it in the store. It just isn't right. They kept trying to charge me more and more money. I could have done better if I had just bought it in the store. | 64758738|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|54
2 | IRA contributions and this review program The program keeps referring to IRA contribution eligibility. I am not eligibile for any type of IRA contribution. I and my spouse are both over 70 and do not work.



Nicknames are nicknames. They should not be required to be a certain length. If I am known as J I am known as J. The IRA contribution and deduction program should be modified. | 64757543|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|55
3 | Not as advertised I've used Turbo Tax for 10 years and always find it helps in loading information and filling forms. However, the advertising is misleading in stating that one State filing is free. I had to pay twice for our joint filing and my dependent son's refund. Advertising said one free state.

1 | Poor directions for Electronic filing I thought my return was filed once my TurboTax payment method was entered. There should be easily noticed instruction to go forward and complete the electronic signing area at the TurboTax payment area. I "filed" on March 15, 2015, Patiently waited for my return payments to post and forgot about it. Today is April 27, 2016. I checked the status of my Fed Return and there was no information on it. I imagine if I check my State Return the same would occur. I am now delinquent on both returns. Not happy at all. efiling instructions unclear | 64756478|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|57

3 | tax credit Turbo tax is boring. it doesnt give you suggestions on how you could lower your tax further. during the process, it may somehow gives you a link so you could read up.

1 | very difficult to file this year!!! Because I could NOT pay for audit protection on April 19th (the last day for filing - I live in MAINE), and because I had to enter driver's license information, I was not able to file my taxes in time. And now, because there is NO option to set up payment arrangements for my MAINE state taxes (even though in the program it said it could!), I am still unable to file my state taxes. I am very frustrated and unsatisfied not being able to make payment, not being able to set up payments | 64496629|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|62
2 | Wouldn't Recommend there are hidden fees everywhere and is not as user friendly as it likes to say it is. I missed out on my refund last year because of turbotax not notifying me that there was an error.. They still charged me for filing my taxes even though it says i didn't file with them. This will be the last year use turbo tax. I wouldn't recommend. hidden fees and horrible costumer service | 64490595|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|63
3 | Not Satisfied I contributed to ROTH IRA, Even after entering the contribution details, turbo tax showed deductions as NIL and infact took me to its partner website ( MInted.com) to create an IRA acount . I found this to be ridiculous .

Also i had issue in submitting my tax returns , turbo tax failed to send me emails asking me to fix my errors and refile it even after the deadline to file taxes got over. Bad business ethics | 64432630|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|64
1 | Not great this year I filed for an extension and was approved but the IRS never received my estimated tax payment info even though I sent it in on 4/18. TT does not give you a receipt for the direct debit payment and after checking my bank account everyday, on 4/27 I filed my taxes and entered my payment info again. I will either get double billed or owe the IRS interest and penalty payment. Not happy, this is the first time this has occurred. IRS did not receive payment | 64431868|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|65

I finished my taxes by 3:00pm 04/18/2016 , every time I tried to update my computer it would freeze. When I read all the question and answers this happen to quite a few people. I am now 9 days late with filing my taxes. Do your work, so we don't have these problems. This may be my last year doing my taxes with Turbo tax. Very tired and unhappy. The people that were helping me were great. You don't pay them enough to take abuse from your clients. Talked to several people as each time you call back you get a new person and must start over. All updates should be done before putting Turbo Tax on my computer. | 64429822|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|67
1 |  I was led to believe that my ohio tax return was efiled, but apparently not. the lady on the turbo tax help line said she was "sorry" that I did not do things correctly!

Now I have to wait another 2 week before receiving my refund. Was not clear on on finishing up the filing process | 64427737|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|69

2 | Too Many add on's for $$$ I don't think I'll be using Turbo Tax next year. They wanted me to spend an extra $100 to file the business documents for $1400 of extra income. Does not make sense. Phone support was not available, FAQ did not answer my questions.



Plus they constantly offered upgrades, additional services, etc. 



Also, it does not make sense when you just need to fix one area, to be required to go through all the screens again to get to that specific area. 



It could actually be simpler. So much so that I'll probably either use a different system next year or go back to paper. too many options to purchase more | 64405919|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|73

3 | Not As Good As It Used to Be The Home & Business App needs a lot more detail for business situations. When trying to get answers from help, the program sends me to the IRS which either has no answer or so complicated an answer that it is not helpful. Specifically you need to make more help available for Net Loss Carry Forward. Also the program asks for us to provide a photocopy of ID for ID Theft but doesn't say how to upload or where to send. The program did not carry forward my loss from last year. So maybe user error but the old Turbo Tax would have made it simpler. I also don't appreciate the fact that it is not easy to go to the Forms method as available in previous versions. I have used Deluxe version in the past with less hassle but now that option is not available to me. Overall a disappointing experience. I have been a TurboTax customer for decades but will be investigating other options for 2016. Too many "help" items that didn't help | 64402191|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|79

As if it's not enough being a tax payer with no money on your debit card, they take more from you...

This year, I thought I was all filled... Was waiting for confirmation of taxes being accepted by federal and state IRS. 



Realized I had not gone. Went in to turbo account. apparently I missed final step ??? I did my husband and my ID, I put in bank info. I thought I was done and was waiting for refund (and payment to KY) But it wasn't actually filed? Ahhhh!

What kind of penalty is that going to be????



Turbo tax had sent me reminders to complete filing through out process of working on taxes, I can't imagine why I wouldn't have received something when my information so complete, but apparent'y not finished.

1 | Missed out on tax return I tired to load my info from last year´s tax return but this was not possible until I paid first, however when I paid it was no longer possible to load last year´s info and I had to start from zero. On top of that I had no other option then to pay for the more expensive version. While I received last year a refund of $2,370, this year I merely got $392 while nothing in my situation has changed, unfortunately I could not ¨mirror¨last years return because TurboTax did not let me load last year´s info. I tried to resolve with the help desk which was impossible, when I finally got through after wait time of more than an hour I was referred to a tax expert and finally I had to give up after another hour of wait on the phone. I have been using TurboTax for many years but this is the first time that I needed help and I couldn´t get any .... very poor experience and clearly I missed out on a tax refund !  | 64358624|1|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|90

1 | High Fees TurboTax does NOT partner with Non-Profit Credit Unions. If this "Corporation as a Person" does, it certainly fails populate a user's credit union. In addition, the fees for filing a 1040 are too high! Also Intuit's Turbo Tax manipulates 1040 filers to pay $35 to some Bank to have their tax refund deposited digitally. TOTALLY ABSURD! The online application does not make this $35 fee clear unless one reads all of the agreements, and then "doubles back" to "un-check" the "direct deposit" box. UNBELIEVABLE INTUIT and BANKS! You need to be THAT GREEDY?! I believe that last year this option was FREE! I won't be using Turbo Tax ever again. High Fees, TurboTax does NOT partner with Non-Profit Credit Unions | 64294932|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|94
3 | Great but pricey I love absolutely everything about TurboTax. TurboTax is easily the BASE that every program should be. The clean interface is the best and should be an industry standard across all programs that serve to a user. The only thing that I absolutely hate is the price. I really wish TurboTax would have discounts for stuents or cut their prices by half. So this may be a biased review but the program is great. I reaffirm, TurboTax is great. I just wish it were a whole lotta cheaper. PRICEY, EXPENSIVE | 64291030|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|95

1 | Highly Disappointed I was very disappointed to find out that not only did I pay $50 to be able to start filing my state taxes, but when I was finished, there was an additional fee to e-file online costing a total of $75 which I did not know. That's not appealing at all and I was surprised that I was not informed. Because of this, I won't be purchasing Turbo Tax again. I had to pay to buy Turbo Tax a second time for state taxes and then had to pay an additional fee in order to efile | 64262088|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|98
1 | Poor Turbo Tax Mechanics for entering IP PIN Why is the IP PIN entered under Personal - Other Tax Situations? Very illogical. Why does Turbo Tax NOT SPECIFICALLY AND SINGULARLY ask the user if they have IP PIN numbers from the IRS to add. Lots of people do. Needs to be a STAND-ALONE PROMPT. Your Fix-it button and solution were just flat out, and comically, wrong. The directions told me to go to Federal Tax File tab - Other Tax Situations.... Just ask Angela, she saw my computer on 25Apr16 between 5:15 - 5:30 PM EDT.

Also, why did I not get an email from you stating my Return was rejected by the IRS? I shall be contacting you, for payment, if I get any kind of penalties or have issues with the IRS. You all really messed up my taxes for this year.

Shame on you. Tell your CEO, I'd love to hear from him and have him answer the questions I posed above.

Regards, Location of where IP PIN is entered is faulty. Turbo Tax does not prompt user to input IP PIN numbers. Fix it is wrong | 64260372|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|99

3 | Previous years I'm disappointed. This has been such a life saving program for us until this year.

I couldn't go back to add ins form that I did not know was coming in mail. I tried to go 1 level up in coverage, program grabbed it & I couldn't go back to drop the extra cost because I didn't need all of it.

Just seems that with our issues this year we should have qualified for help with utilities or something.

He's disabled, I'm on workmans comp. paying my own health ins. & we are trying to live on $1,700 a month & still pay for our own meds. & I have co-pays of $40+.

Oh well, I won't be singing Turbo Taxes praises and if I have no other choice I will be far more careful using your program.

2 | Less Helpful for Iowa Tax Iowa has an unusual joint return filing separately on the same return. This involves separating a married couples income. TurboTax did some of this, but left me to do a lot without any help. The forms being used are hidden, so I'm not sure how well it was done. Although all the information was entered Turbo Tax was useless for dividing joint income. | 64256570|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|104

1 | Frustration This year I found this program to be difficult to follow and understand. When I needed help, I had a hard time getting it. I just wanted someone to talk me through the problems I was having. It took me two and a half hours to get signed in. When I was finished, I was relieved to be done. When taxes didn't come out of my account, I went back in and found that I wasn't finished. I swear I thought I was finished when I got to the screen that said taxes would be withdrawn from my account on April 18, 2016. difficult to get help | 64254488|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|106

1 | You're a scheme That you take $34.99 for to pay using your tax return is a total scheme. You don't really make it clear that it costs $34.99 to pay with your tax return as opposed to a credit card. That's a total hit on low-income people without access to a credit or debit card or people who don't realize. I will surely speak poorly about Turbotax to anyone that I can.

3 | 1099 Issues My wife had a 1099 and while Turbo Tax let me enter the information as income it became confusing later in the process. It listed the husband of the owner of the business on the Schedule C form. Neither the husband nor the wife was the owners. It made a $300 difference depending on whom was selected as the owner which was forced. There was no option to select otherwise. Some Problems with 1099 | 64234440|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|111

2 | Oops, filed late I know it's probably the tax process in general, but I found it to be quite difficult, and I've been working in technology for 30 years. I filed my federal taxes on time, or so I thought, only to find out when I went in to file state taxes, that my federals had never been filed. When I filed them again, I remember going through all the same screens but have no idea why they didn't file. I got TT because it was the first year I had a small business and I needed some way to print W-2's. Still didn't know what some questions were asking me | 64233761|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|113

2 | Not very easy for military w/tuition assistance Turbotax needs to do a better job of helping active duty military members input their 1098 T taking the tuition assistance into consideration.

3 | late return filing I spent a lot of time completing the return and completing the filing was the most difficult due to a fee for an extra service that kept popping up. Also, the bigger problem is that I was under the impression that I filed on 4/15/16. Just now when I went in to check on the status of my return I see that there were still steps left over and I have just now filed LATE. This concerns me because I do not want to be fined for filing late. Please let me know why it was not already filed when I recall that it went through on 4/15/16. An extra fee kept popping up for a service that I did not want. | 64232995|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|116
2 | It was easy to file 1040A It should not be an issue if I file it or someone else in my family.

3 | Not enough control TurboTax gets the job done but not without some frustration. The new version does not let you see what is being entered into your forms until you purchase a version. This is annoying. You also need to re-answer questions multiple times if you want to go back and change something. I would like to click on a value in a form and be able to edit that particular section - not every section associated with that schedule. 



Every value in a form/schedule that relies on aggregated data should show a pop-up of that data when mousing over. For instance the income could show the various contributions when you mouse over the number(s). 



The final tax document that TurboTax saved to my desktop was not quite correct. We have health insurance (and we answered the question correctly in TurboTax). However the PDF of our Tax forms does not have the correct box checked. This is hopefully correct on the electronic version being submitted to the IRS. Of course if we had filed via mail we would need to be vigilant and check these. Seeing actual forms when entering data is really helpful | 64232427|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|118
1 | Excessive frustration, FEES You added fees, making it impossible to get out of being charged. At no point was I ever asked if I wanted to elect to pay for the FREE service. You lied! I will NEVER use Turbo Tax again! was not easy or accurate, I was lied to, it was NOT free (false advertising) | 64232028|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|119
3 |  I thought I had submitted my taxes on line on 3/29/16 but didn't hit the submit button and Turbotax fails to email and notify me that my taxes wasn't completed. This could create me trouble with IRS since I just discover today that it wasn't sent but Turbotax did not email me any information that it was not completed.  | 64231289|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|120

1 | Information held hostage by buying Plus All of my information was not transferred to my 2015 from my 2014 because i did not purchase the plus this year with threats like " all of your past information will be deleted" .

Next year someone else will get my business unless the additional state rates are reduced significantly.

2 | This year was much more confusing I opened the program, and entered only my name when my refund of $35 appeared. That number remained the same throughout the entries all through my final refund which was $35 (coincidence?). Suspected a problem, so went out and bought the disc (as opposed to the TDAmeritrade on-line version)--same result, but the disc was somewhat clearer and more comprehensive.

The timeline was so limiting as to be useless in terms of navigating from one point to another. Could not retrieve my 2014 import, so had to enter all (twice) from scratch. Will not likely use Turbo Tax next year after being a many-consecutive- year user. Flow of program didn't match 1040 | 64230205|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|125
2 | Purchased deluxe Not sure how to rate owning All data from income forms entered as in past years. Went to file state and said $24.99 due. Called and spoke to rep who was very helpful and saw that one state filing was included with the Deluxe. Helped me clear issue and I e-filed. State e-file was rejected. I checked income input on form indicated and saw all data had been entered correctly. Just to be sure I retyped data on income form indicated and refiled under e-file. This happened not once but twice. They said if I still had issues they could help me file by mail; that's not what I paid for. This is the first year I purchased Trubo Tax Deluxe and used for filing. Strange how I never had an issue e-filing State tax before using on line turbo tax and paying additional for state filing and now I do..... No changes in type of income either.

1 | Not notified that tax payment was rejected! I filed federal and state return and received "return accepted" notice on Turbo Tax for status. But little did I know that my tax payment had been rejected by my bank until I received a letter a week later from IRS. Why didn't Turbo tax notify me?? I c checked my e-payment and sent payment again before due date of return. Tax return accepted but no notice from Turbo Tax that payment was rejected | 64224500|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|127
3 | Forgot to file I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for over 20 years and found it easy and fast (for me) until this year.

Still easy & fast but somehow the filing screen led me to believe that I had filed (submitted both state & federal forms) when I had not.

To my shock when I looked for my refund on 4/24 it was not there.



Went back to Turbo Tax and it indicated I had not filed.



Turbo Tax needs to alert preparers that the filing is not complete somehow or improve there product.

3 | So-so This is not a product to be used by those unfamiliar with TurboTax and/or with tax form completion in general. The help topics are not particularly clear. Moving back and forth between views can be confusing. 

One issue that was particularly annoying pertained to printing and saving PDFs of the documents. When all I wanted print/save were state documents, the check box for federal documents kept re-checking by default every time I moved from one screen to another. Why? troubling coding | 64221665|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|132
3 | A little frustrated I have a small investment in a venture capital fund, and the Deluxe edition did not allow me to complete the input of Schedule K-1 information. TurboTax requires me to spend an additional $50 and purchase the Home & Business version. I decided to override the limitation, print out the needed form and file the return by mail. And I needed to do this to take advantage of a $65 loss. In the past, I was able to complete this information using the Deluxe edition. I hope that Turbo Tax will reconsider its offerings in the future. Disappointed in limitations in Deluxe edition | 64218129|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|133

2 | 2015 TurboTax Review Frustrated with Turbo Tax 2015 when loaded onto computer with Window 10. The program would not update. Therefore not all forms were available. This caused considerable frustration not knowing what was wrong and why the program would not update. Eventually downloaded program onto computer with Window 7 and the program work smoothly thereafter. Because of this difficultly with Window 10, the tax return was submitted one week late.

"Print front screen", does not print the form on the screen, it prints something different. 4. Nice if one could view online the actual income tax instruction booklets one used to obtain from libraries & post offices to refer to those instructions for working on one's return.

When I tried to contact you for instructions on what to do I got nothing but a useless computer generated "associate". There was no help on your site. I am truly disappointed.

I was terribly disappointed when I found that I could not import my It's Deductible data into Turbo Tax because I was locked out of the website. I was locked out for about 6 weeks and tech support was abysmal. One techie had me log in numerous time using a new password each time - that is until I passed the daily log in allowance and was locked out completely for 24 hours. Finally I was put in touch with the TTaxInvestigations group and they got me connected. After that, the software did it's job and filed my taxes.

1 | TROUBLE THE FIRST TIME I DID MY OWN TAXES SINCE 1962 WAS LAST YEAR 2014. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME BECAUSE I DIDN;T KNOW TREMS ETS. BUT, I LOVED IT AND WAS jumping up and down happy with your program. This year 2015 tax was a nightmare. I spent 2 to 4 hours a day on support services with multiple problems. The first one was trouble with buying it. In retrospect the problem there was nobody asked me if I was using a Mac and therefore didn't recognize that I didn't where my downloads were. and of course they weren't when she was telling me.I just kept saying I didn't receive it because I couldn't find it and of course multiple copies were in my download file which I figured out the next morning.. It would have saved both me and the nice person helping me a lot of frustration if you just routinely ask people if they were using a Mac. The next day the problem was finding the forms that I had two thirds filled out. All I could find were all of the blank forms. The next DAY was the inability to open the form. then something decided that both my password and username were incorrect. That problem was never solved by a most helpful person. It still didn't work when we changed the user name and password twice. I finally gave up and on Sunday started all over again with a new form. Almost all of these problems would be solved if you sent me to the Mac group and also if you had a program to screen share with Mac. I'm not a person who cries much but this brought me to tears on several occasions. I probably will use you again because you're the most highly rated but then again I may not and certainly if I start out having problems I will quit. One of the most frustrating things was that Daniel who was most helpful tried to find out if I could get my money back since I hadn't submitted anything because I was just going to go and give it to my old accountant. It was left that I would receive an email because my brain was so tired I couldn't stand staying online waiting for the answer. I never got an answer. That's inexcusable. I certainly didn't save any money over taking it to my accountant given the amount of time lost. MINIMAL MAC SUPPORT THAT YOU DON'T TELL US ABOUT | 64153059|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|164

2 | Difficulty filing First of all, Turbotax missed a couple of items. If I hadn't been reading the pubs, I would have missed some key points. Not only that, I had to go looking to find out where to insert them. Could have been a MAJOR problem.

Second, I selected to file my fed return on April 15. I found out on the 20th they hadn't been filed. I found out on the 22nd that they had been rejected. I refiled them today. 

I tried to order the "insurance" item, and still don't know if that "took", and if I am covered.

1 | Disappointed user I filed two sets of returns on the filing deadline 4/18/16. First set of federal and state transmitted without problems. My personal returns which I owed ~$3k on federal return with refund on state took me through the entire menu, I input CC information and hit transmit. Screen indicated file transmitted successfully. Last few days I was monitoring my bank account to make sure the $3k was deducted. Never happened so I checked my email and no notification of filing was received. I checked the return this morning and the status said never printed never filed. I have the 40 page return printed and sitting on my desk. My drivers license information was entered as was my bank account information which transferred over from last years return. Not sure what happened but now my return is late and IRS will assess penalty. Have used TT for years and very happy with product but disappointed with what happened this year with my return. I bought Deluxe and had 5 returns I could file of which I used 4. Don't know if an update came through which caused the returns not to be filed. Should have checked my email for confirmation, a mistake I'll never make again, but screen said returns were filed so I took it face value. When I went back in and filed the return this morning, I was prompted by a message suggesting to sign up for an alternative application when filing more than 5 returns. As I said I filed 4 returns, the one this morning 4/22/16 was the fourth. The message prompt leads me to believe the unsuccessful transmission Monday of my returns is being calculated by TT as a successful transmission but it never was sent. Very disappointing considering I had the return done for a while but since I owed money I opted to pay at the extended filing deadline and now for the first time in my life I'm filing late and will be charged penalties.!!!!!!! Return marked e-filed on 4/18 was never filed! | 64121704|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|176
3 | Thot I filed 3 days early... Was proud of myself for having everything ready to file 3 days before the deadline. The "new" efile requirements apparently tripped me up and my returned didn't get filed until i logged back in and did it a second time - 3 days late. Fortunately the Premier Edition had helped me find enough credits to get a refund, so I don't think there will be any IRS blow-back. e-filing too complicated now | 64115435|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|177

3 | Mixed feelings this year Mostly fine experience, but disappointed that some info from last year's return did not auto-populate for this year's return despite fact I had filed with TurboTax last year, too. Especially frustrating because I then had to close out of my return in progress, sign back in, access last year's return from my account archive, and then close out again, and sign in yet again to continue my 2015 return. Shouldn't be that difficult. Some items did not auto-populate from TurboTax 2014 return | 64114740|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|180
3 |  When I first e-filed my Fed return, it was rejected. After I made necessary correction to my return, and I tried to re-efile, I was instructed that I had to "re-set credit card authorization". Tech support gave me a phone number to call. Turned out it was a number to a different efile servicer (pay1040.com) instead of the original Intuit servicer that handled the tax payment the first time. I just wish the process can be made simpler. What happened also was the amount of tax due the first time I efiled became a pending transaction in my credit card, while the larger tax due charged to my card (by pay1949) went through and was debited to my card. I will now have to contact my credit card company to stop the pending transaction.  | 64114607|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|181

I didn't find out until I called the IRS, to see why they hadn't yet taken my payment, because I owed! Turbo Tax only said when I filed the first time that my Taxes were sent and completed. No email or text updates that my return was actually REJECTED!!!! I ORIGANILLY FILED IN FEBRUARY!

In February I filed and thought I finished the process. I felt I needed to verify that a week before tax day and found out that wasn't the case, their software indicated that I already e-files and could not resubmit though the IRS did not receive the files. Now I have to fight to remove a penalty for late filing. I like what Turbo Tax has to offer, BUT the e-filing process needs to be fixed. Didn't file when the software indicated I did. | 64113911|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|184

This information should have transferred into the right place when I did a TXF from my brokerage. Please correct this glitch for next year's return. Thanks

3 | Could not efile due to IND-032-02 error I tried numerous times to fix this IND-032-02 error and could not obtain a filing pin for my wife and also was rejected when attempting to file by using the AGI for 2014. I verified the amount was correct with the IRS but no one could help me other than tell me to file by mail. Now I am a few days late because of what should have been a seemless transaction. I had no issues in 2014 doing roughly the same routine. Unable to eFile | 64113346|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|187

1 | Straddling the Line The product seems to favor vague answers to questions. Specific information is, ostensibly, reserved for other people's liability.

3 | Submit nightmare I thought I had submitted my taxes a week before the due date, but I had only agreed to the financing and printed them. There needs to be clearer information before printing that they have not been submitted yet, only requested to print. I ended up noticing that the money had not been removed from my bank account 3 days after the due date, and went in to see why not. That is when i found out that I had not submitted them officially.

Secondly, there needs to be a little more detailed explanation for the pages having to do with social security income, pulling money out of an IRA, and any other deduction that may occur out of the ordinary "plain jane" filing.

1 | Wtf happened? Free means free right? I was charged 50$ for doing my taxes... I don't remember checking any boxes to add additional "perks/packages."



When did the FREE option start costing money?

I went back and fourth through the tax return process double checking where I could have possibly added any additional charges and couldn't find ANYTHING.

Sucks I was charged it's my fault for waiting so long to do my taxes but next year I won't be returning to turbotax. Charges, payment, forced into premium charges | 64110331|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|195
3 | All the fees Obviously this system of filing is fine and I have used it for several years. I think that this year it seems to be so many confusing things about how much it costs to use this system. There seems to be an extra fee and the cost has gone up. I hated all the add-ons they kept trying to sell you. I get that it's a business, but don't attempt to scheme people. I don't even know if I needed the deluxe version, but I couldn't find other options. 



Probably won't use it anymore.  | 64109944|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|196

1 | TurboTax Nightmare! I was not happy to learn that turbo tax filed my return without my acknowledgement. Apparently the "free" feature allows turbo tax to transmit data without completely e-filing. Since I never hit e-file, or paid, or received notification stating anything, when I finally completed my taxes and submitted, it was rejected. What a nightmare to submit this once again. Everything had to be done manually. I don't think i'll be using TurboTax anyomre. filed my taxes without notifying me!!! | 64108692|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|200
2 | Not as easy or understandable as in previous years I have used TurboTax for many years now. I have previously found your product to be easy to use and transparent. This year, I found the Home and Business version quite cumbersome, particularly with regard to my LLC and filing my California return. I started a business at the end of 2015. According to California's tax law, I did not have to file a form 568 or pay the minimum $800 LLC tax since the business was in operation for less than 14 days in 2015. Nevertheless, TurboTax generated a form 568 for 2015 and suggested that I file it along with the $800. I spoke with a tax professional, who told me not to file the form or pay the $800, but neither of us could figure out why TurboTax did not take the date on which I started my business into account. I must have answered a question incorrectly somewhere in the program, but I have no idea where. Like I said, the current version just seemed less transparent than in previous years. Home and Business version was very cumbersome, non-transparent, and generated a form that should not have been filed | 64107884|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|201

1 |  Several hidden charges you don't find out about until you've already done everything. First it only charged me for one of my two states I filed for, then when I deleted one I didn't have to file for, the free state became $30. Then when I readded the second state, I was charged $30 each. I'm using the free edition. There should be no charges. The charges aren't even consistent. I would like my $60 back.  | 64100774|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|204

1 | Still prefer pen and paper I am biased because I prefer to write the IRS a check for the tax payer money that I was holding onto for them, so the longer it takes them to wire the money the better for me. Otherwise e-filing does not feel particularly more convenient despite the advantages of modern technology. Actually took longer and was less satisfying then doing it by hand | 64097291|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|206

Why can't the errors be fixed all at the same time? Why can I not transfer my business info from quick books? Why did my information from last year not save? Why are you asking question about my husbands ex-wife? Answer some or all of these questions I may come back next year. If not any, I may not be back at all.

Unfortunately, I had to have my spouse go to post office and spend a couple of unplanned hours standing in line to post-mark a check to IRS. Software should have worked the first time. Disappointed.

2 | Charged me when I shouldn't have been charged. The reason I use TurboTax is because its free for military service members. I am a sergeant (E-5) in the US Army and according to TurboTax that means I am able to file for free. Instead I was charged almost $100 to file. Now I have to jump through hoops to get this corrected because TurboTax made an error. Additionally I tried to nip this in the bud (because I could see the discount not being applied) by using their help function to ask a question but the answer I received was "we'll apply the discount automatically" which was not the case. Now not only did I get my credit card charged $100 to file but my taxes are late as well. I was charged when I shouldn't have been. | 64072183|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|219

2 | PA State - needs improvement Mac product - Deluxe (installed from CD).



I was very disappointed with the state version, due initially to the very confusing handling of a dual-state W-2, where a portion of withholding had already been taken for NJ (a reciprocal state to PA), and the majority withheld for PA. By default, income from the two states showing up in Box 15 was added together, almost doubling the real income. Turbotax failed to recognize and adjust for this, and failed to give any guidance in this case, although to be fair, the Intuit support person I eventually reached gave excellent guidance (2nd start for that - thanks!). I still half expect to hear back from the state about an adjustment, though.



The navigation (or lack thereof) really got on my nerves, esp. given the frustration with the above situation. There is no way to jump in at a particular point in the return like in federal (i.e., lets user decide what to work on). I had to repeatedly advance screen by screen to get back to where I wanted to edit or continue. This shocked me (in this technologically advanced age), but maybe the state product has always been that rudimentary, and I've been luckier to have a more straightforward return. Given that the federal product has these features, I expected them to be available in the state product as well.



Another annoyance that I noticed with the federal product - I seem to recall a visual indicator in older versions that something was marked 'estimated', but that's not the case now. Of course, they will show up during the review at the end, but it would be useful to also have an indication when simply looking at it, without having to set a flag manually, or wait for the error check at the end. Could be different font color, with italics, etc. I don't remember how it was indicated in the past.



I also noticed a typo in the state product (escapes me where it was, but might've been in a help screen), where two words were run together. Since spell check should pick that up, it just seems sloppy to me, and an indication that not much effort is put into the state product (the last straw for me, today).



Finally, I'm unhappy with the outcome - since my deluxe version only includes one state, i will have to spend another $40 or so (not sure of exact amount) for the NJ product, just to file a non-resident return, in order to get $300 back. I would like to see more client-friendly pricing for non-resident / out of state income, for example, a price break on getting and filing for a multi-state situation, for a single individual or joint filing.



'Nuff Said. State version does not provide easy navigation like federal product. | 64070767|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|222

1 | Late Filer Due to Turbo Tax We had our taxes completed and thought they were filed on 4/18/206. After waiting for the automatic checking account deduction from our account that never occurred. We finally checked Turbo Tax. We tried over and over to efile. It would never complete. The final "Continue" button just never did anything. No message, no nothing. We had to go back and efile the Federal taxes only, and printed out our Colorado taxes and will file them via mail. 



Due to Turbo tax, we now have a late file, and paid the extra 2.49% to file by a credit card instead of an automatic withdrawal from our checking account.



In addition, Turbo Tax/Intuit charged our account in November 2015 without our approval. 



We have used Turbo Tax for years and are very disappointed in this product. It could not send my state and so didn't send my Federal either | 64070464|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|225
3 | getting better and worse Yes, it's faster and more intelligent but the bugs are worse and require too much workaround.

3 | 5 years with Turbotax I've used the free edition of TurboTax for several years. I'm confident that my taxes are quite simple, and would need nothing more than a 1040 or EZ. I've filed my taxes by paper before, so the ease of entering things on the computer certainly makes it convenient. 



This time, since I was delayed in getting around to completing my filing this year, I decided to go with the plus version. Not quite deluxe, but it offered to auto-populate some fields from previous filings. It also said I would get a military discount. So why not? It did save some time on the front end, but the other plus benefits didn't quite meet my expectations. And I didn't get the military discount at the end. 



Another person with slightly more complicated taxes might find the benefit in the service, however, I feel like it was heavily marketed to me to use it, and didn't meet my expectations. I'll stick with the free version next time. Marketing | 64070243|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|228

3 | I compared Turbo Tax with my CPA I always hire a professional CPA to do and file my actual return because I have a complex situation. I later used TurboTax as a mathematical model to do sensitivity analysis to figure out, say, if I earned $1000 more or less, how my taxes would really change, or if I gave $1000 more or less to charity, how the taxes would change.



Turbo tax uses a much simpler approach to capital gains than the CPA, so simple I'm not sure I would trust it. The result was, I would have paid $60 less Federal tax with TurboTax but $1100 more than advised by my CPA for State of Illinois Tax. My CPA charged around $500 for the service.



I think you need to use a human professional if you have a complex situation. But there's still a use for TurboTax as a model for financial planning and analysis, even if you use the CPA for your real return. It's serving me well for that purpose.



Better yet let's choose a President who will introduce a flat tax you can file on a postcard! My CPA saved me $1100 I would have paid with TurboTax on state taxes | 64070076|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|230
1 | Refiling because of Turbo Tax "error" scam? Turbotax spent too much promoting how easy it was to file. It was NO EASIER than paper returns. TurboTax was OBVIOUSLY designed by coders and GUI experts with little regard to the customer or the human call center "experts." It's WINDOZE push button end screens do NOT allow for logical decisions -- just railroading to the TurboTax way.

2 | So So I had some changes with my part time employment as a sport official and changing the vehicles I used. While i appreciate a program to guide me through such a complicated tax system I found several problems to be so ambiguous I'm still not sure if everything was correct. Not sure that I will continue with TurboTax in the future. Things should be so much more clear to file which leads me to another bone to pick. I pay $60 for the program and when I go to file they sell a $45 audit assist program because we should be frightened and to top it off it will cost me an additional $25 to file my state return. don't feel that they sell this clearly upfront.

Opened customer service page at least 20 times in the 3 1/2 hours I went around and around with you clowns. no phone number, no workable tabs, anything.

1 | Easy in, killing me out I've used TurboTax for years and never had a problem...until now.



Your review says there are no errors, yet my taxes get rejected by the IRS. You say you'll guide me to fix the problem, but all you do is direct me to a line on my 1040 that I can neither change or affect. To make things worse, the only way to get there is by leaving what little direction I get from you to get to the window where I'm supposed to make the corrections that you've given me no direction on how to fix.



Help? No, I'm not going to get that. All I'm going to get is an online Q&A and FAQ without anyone to walk me through the problem.



It might be time for a new tax software. Absolutely poor support and review. If my taxes have no errors during your review, then why would they be rejected?? | 64069489|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|237

1 | Worst experience I have ever had with TurboTax We have 2 businesses. After I had carefully entered all of the income and expense information for these businesses, I was prompted to reenter certain information for purposes of Schedule C during the review portion of the program. This led to duplicate entries, because I had already entered the information. When I realized what happened, I had to go back and redo my business expenses. Then, the program wanted me to make those corrections again. I called and spoke to a TurboTax representative who had no idea why I was encountering this problem or what to do to avoid it. After several hours of trying, I figured out how to circumvent this feature of the program. Program repeatedly prompted me to make duplicate entries during the review portion. | 64068612|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|241

2 | One thing bugged me I owed $40 to the Fed. Turbo Tax said "You can deduct the tax preparation expense" which turned out to be around $60 after sales tax. I figured, I could cut what I owe down to $20. Well, you can only deduct tax preps if it exceeds around $800. You got me on that one turbo tax, I should have looked closer, instead of being out $20, I"m now out $100. Feeling like I'd been had | 64066898|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|247

3 | Meh The product is still pretty easy to use, but your prices have gone up, and I do not appreciate the way you won't let a person with a home loan proceed without itemizing, which costs $50+, even though after making the only available selection, which is to pay you, the itemization process is largely non-applicable. I mean, come on, most average american families have mortgage and property taxes to write off, and that is it. You shouldn't force us to pay for services we are not going to use.

It would not let me edit the box. Finally I discovered that I could delete the form, since it was one I didn't need anyway. I searched TurboTax help online thoroughly and the customer service reps were not helpful at all. The only advice I could fidn to solve this problem was to delete the state and start over. I did that and then encountered a problem with allocating city tax. I needed to change the amount int he blank and it would not let me edit. I have used Turbo Tax for 5 years and have never experienced such frustration. Many areas that could have auto populated did not and did not show any indication on where to find the information.

2 | TurboTax 2012 CD-ROM Mac This year's version of TurboTax was troublesome:



1) Worksheet boxes didn't load immediately when entering numbers and more frustrating was the fact that the details entered in to the worksheet didn't always save from one session to the next.



2) Calculations for disposition of a vehicle weren't automatically calculated and entered such as prior depreciation AMT and AMT depreciation equivalent, but neither was there an explanation of how to do the calculations. Many had written to the support page on this very topic, but there were no answers. I had to find the answer at Justanswer .com. 



3) When the calculations were entered and the "red flag" went away I was told the sale price of my disposed vehicle was such and such. But I never sold the vehicle. It was totaled in an accident.

I was not getting the reduction I expected based on previous years, and so I had to call in and review the relevant IRS literature.



The IRS calculation (Worksheet 4-1) yielded a different value than the TurboTax software, but the support person just kept saying things like "Turbo Tax doesn't have any bugs" and "we stand behind our product, as it calculates everything correctly and never makes any mistakes". I obviously like the TurboTax software - I've used it multiple years in a row. However, I'd rather my questions be treated logically by someone who can explain the underlying calculations and go through them with me in the rare event that I have an issue than someone who is going to be dismissive.  | 64057730|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|269

3 | Reflections of a confusable elderly bachelor A tight schedule due to my procrastination was hampered by the "Free" process which accomplished nothing. 



Until I paid, did any of the effort and especially the time involved I put into the Free process was wasted. 



After discovering that it was a sell process and not a file process much of my valuable procrastinated time had been wasted. That is my fault but this caused me considerable extra work. 



Once I synchronized to how things worked it was relatively easy to go through the process. 



It was annoying to have to pay extra for features I would have considered as basic reasons for using TurboTax. 



I will use TurboTax in the future. At almost 82 I will be glad to have the privilege. Free in the interface for a user was grossly misleading and destructive. | 64052780|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|272
1 | Getting Worse by the Year While Turbo Tax was simple and easy in the past they now charge for access to old returns, they make things intentionally difficult. Example they give a progress bar animation for auto populate form past return, then take it back if you don't upgrade...

I am not impressed TurboTax 2015's lack of logic flow. It does not deliver the user to the correct troubleshooting area, unless the user happens to be very alert, noticing oversights such as: 



1. After an error on my original submission (a dependent incorrectly selected, she was not), I received an Email from TurboTax stating that a "dependent" was incorrectly selected. 



However, once I returned to the TurboTax application, the program delivered me to "resubmitting my filing" WITHOUT making any correction. There was no assistance by TurboTax to deliver me to the correct software page, nor any assistance from TurboTax to identify WHICH dependent was incorrectly annotated on the original filing. That's absurd. Disorganized logic flow(s): does not deliver customer to correct trouble area (correcting dependent, for example). | 64051396|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|275

Every time I got a pass-word agreed, it would be rejected by the system because someone had not added it to the records after the phone staff got it corrected. we went through about 40 versions of the pass word - until I finally called the President's Office for help. Then it moved very quickly & I had my software on my computer in 15 minutes! This was late afternoon 4/18/16.

2 | Disappointed This is the 4th year that I have used TubroTax and its the 2nd year that my tax form has been rejected. Last year I kept using the fix my return and it never got fixed and as a result my taxes were never filed. This year I have run into the same situation. My problem is this, TurboTax makes sure that they get their money up front, this year $104.00 + tax. After that you are left on your own. Instead of a money back guarantee for getting you your biggest refund, how about a money back guarantee if your taxes aren't ever fixed. Also, what about a loyalty discount. I could have used another company for half of what I just paid. The only reason I didn't is because I waited until the last minute to file and their program wasn't familiar to me.

2 | Lack of info made this take too long! I am an American citizen based abroad, and have used TurboTax to file my taxes in previous years in the exact same situation. This time around, TurboTax wouldn't let me access the foreign earned income section, and I just got an error message any time I clicked the link (I tried links in the search box, the "jump to" links and the actual link in my questions while going through the normal process). Each time it gave me an error and logged me out. It never told me this was only available if I upgraded, so I spent an obscene amount of time in the search function, reading other questions and trying over and over again to access the section. Finally I upgraded, and voila! it worked. TurboTax, **just tell me** if I need to upgrade to access a form and it would have saved me hours of headache. 



Finally, at the end of the whole thing, I went to review and it found errors, but it wouldn't direct me to how to correct them. It gave me the option to file without correcting, but when I got there it said I could not e-file and had to mail my returns in. I finally gave up out of frustration and tried again a couple days later, and it worked with no errors and I was able to e-file. 



My tax filing is very straight forward. I easily met the foreign earned income exclusion using the physical presence test and otherwise have nothing unusual. There is no reason it should have been so complicated or hard to fill out my taxes. Error messages with no explanation | 64039188|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|282

I'll bet there would have been some work put into this process if Intuit was soaking me for some extra money for the filing process. I'm sure that they will reduce the number of included fed eFiles next year.

1 | Comparing 2015 Turbo Tax to previous years Unlike the previous years 2015 Turbo Tax software was frustrating and unpleasant. The form 8949 was generated and may have been sent electronically, but the instruction sheet indicated that the form had to be mailed to the IRS. Several users commented and complained about the need to mail the form 8453 with 8949 as an attachment since they were filing their returns electronically. The answers I found on your site were not sufficient to decide one way or another.

I went from a $227 refund, to roughly a $150 refund, using the same process I used to fill out my fiancee's Tax Forms....in which she not only got offered a BY-MAIL check option, but also DID NOT get slammed with two hidden fees.

1 | TurboTax has lost me I'm a long-time TurboTax user, but do not plan on using it next year. We had a few complexities in our taxes this year such as moving and a sole law practice. I had problems with allocating income between states - it seems that TurboTax has less and less explanation and built-in aids each year. Still not sure I have the income correct for my new home state. And, when I needed to indicate that my stock gains were not while I was a resident of my new state, I had to open each entry individually. As some of my stocks had monthly dividend reinvestments, there were a lot of entries. I probably missed a few, which would mean I paid double taxes. In addition, I kept getting errors that showed up in the review that resulted from carryover data from past years. I was not able to fully get rid of it. I will be looking at other options next year. Not up to the job of handling multiple part-year states. Hard to get rid of data entered in previous years. | 64038049|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|300

1 | Free to File- My 4$$! The program itself was fine, but not worth the cost. I actually left an actual tax prep company and came back because it was supposed to be free to file. Turns out not only did I have to do all the work, but I had to pay for it as well. I did all the work and had to pay to file | 64037978|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|302

2 | 2015 Refund Flaws I am a MA resident and our deadline for taxes is April 19, 2016

It said I could not pay on line and also stated I was required to Mail my State Income Tax and could not file on line.

There was no reason listed under review as it stated there would be. Very dissatisfied this year. Would not let me pay online | 64037788|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|304
1 | This year sucks No errors reported in the error check. almost 0 chance of audit. It said I already filed a return using the pin. I used the pin numbers given to me online and my return was rejected twice. I went back to try and find where the error is and everything on my return disappeared. Nothing, zilch. This is pathetic. I may never use turbo tax again.



I may have to start all over and it is now late. This sucks. my return was rejected twice | 64037746|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|305
1 | Bait and switch Was quoted $49.99 for my federal return which included the promise that this is all that I would pay for my federal return. Was forced to pay $79.99 in order to file. The application generally works well with some confusing points. Unfortunately the bait and switch is a customer killer. Will not be back next year and will be warning others.

3 | Turbo tax 16 This version of TurboTax was not nearly as friendly or clear as previous years versions. I wish I would have used a different method or a different application to do my taxes this year. It was the first year I have ever owed money and for the life of me cannot really figure out why. I will probably have someone professional look at this next year to review my 2015 taxes because I don't know if I was guided correctly by the TurboTax. On top of that I spent $110 almost to have my taxes done by TurboTax. When really, it's me doing my taxes. I think it is an overcharge and should be about half that price.

1 | Review As stated in the 'cons' selection, Turbo Tax was extremely misleading because they state that their service is free, or partly free. I ended up paying over $95.00 just for them to tell me that I OWED money (both federal and state). I have NEVER in my life owed anything in my tax returns and don't fully understand how this is possible if I've been paying my taxes all year....how is this possible???? Turbo tax is misleading because they state they are 'free' but yet I ended up paying almost $100 just to find I owed $$$ | 64037324|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|310
3 | My Turbo Tax The service is great because it guides the customer through steps that are simple to understand. It made me feel like I was in charge. I also liked the service's ability to backup and edit or add information at different stages, which made it easier to use because I always had the ability to add things that I remembered. This allowed me to make better use of the service.

The electronic banking fee at the very end (in addition to the filing fee) is rather compelling because it becomes realized after the customer’s investment of time and effort becomes optimally expended. It is very difficult for a customer to say no or deny him/herself the filing service and banking fees, after investing time and effort into the Turbo Tax service. It is not funny and I didn’t like finding out about it so late into the process. However, I decided to pay the fee because I want my return to be filed expeditiously and I also want the convenience of direct deposit. I’m willing to pay for it. I just don’t appreciate the last second banking fee at the very end. Your service is fast and convenient. Turbo Tax doesn’t have to trick people in to paying for it. Turbo Tax is great because it is simple to use and it has the depth that customers, like me, enjoy. Is it necessary to delay the notice of the banking fee until the very end? Not for me. I’ll pay for the service anyway. But, you might lose other customers who can be negatively influenced by competitive advertisement and gossip.

Your survey is also narrow-minded because it lists its rules and reasonable expectations before it starts. This, to me, is a defensive posture that your service demonstrates before the customer even begins the survey. It’s like saying “tell us what you think, but only in a way that we like it…please don’t tell what you really think, especially if it is something that we don’t like.” Everyone knows that when two parties communicate, defensive statements always validate the complainant’s position. If you don’t like what people are going to say, you shouldn’t ask for their input. But, you won’t know what people really think unless you give them the environment to speak freely.

3 | TT Premier 2015 The user interface doesn't seem to be improving in the past 3 years. It gets the job done for latest tax law, but there should be an early screen asking for basic changes to your finances such as "did you sell or buy a house" or "did you have a child" or "Did you change employers" or whatever is necessary to narrow down the topics I need to address instead of the present situation making me deal with a lot of things that don't apply out of the 10 income topics, 12 deduction topics, etc. This would be particularly useful when I do my offspring's taxes who has few assets and little income.

Bottom line: find ways to get me through this process faster! Even with all the records I need in front of me, it still takes several evenings to do my taxes with TT!

1 |  2014: 

I e-filed using Turbotax for 2014. Later the IRS sent me a letter stating that I never filed for 2014. I printed a copy and sent by mail to the IRS.



2015: 

I tried to e-file with Turbotax for 2015. The IRS rejected my e-file stating that either the PIN is incorrect, or I didn't file for 2014 (vague, still not clear if they ever processesed 2014 yet). I'm going to mail 2015 to the IRS. failed to e-file again | 64036925|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|313

Now I was very tired and frustrated so after being up trying till 1230am I went to bed to get up for work. 

I called turbo tax after work and talked to "Russell" who was amazing! But I couldn't get wifi. So I had to han g up and try when I got home. I called again and this young lady was so awesome! She was so calm and patient with me and helped me to succeed and file my son's taxes...Thank you turbo tax I had trouble with finding the tabs to edit | 64036870|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|315

1 | Good thing gone Bad. Any other year I would have said I was a big fan of Turbo Tax. I have been using them to file my taxes for the last 4 years now with no problems. This year however I get all the way through filling everything out and just before the last couple clicks to actual send everything off to the IRS a little box shows up saying please pay $29.99 to complete and file.



Granted its not much, but the point is that they waited till I was all the way through the process to let me know I was going to have to pay for “help” services that I barely used, and might not have used had they let me know ahead of time that I was going to be charged for it. I even recommended Turbo Tax to a friend this year and they paid $50 for an upgraded version because they had more things they had to factor in then I did.



Its just that fact that they waited till the last minute, after all the work was done, to tell me I was going to be charged that really disappoints me. Had I known up front I would have considered it a reasonable fee and had no problem. But they didn't. So I'm off to read a few reviews to help me decide who I will be using next year. If your doing the same I hope this helps. Hidden Fees | 64036842|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|317

1 | A Horrible Experience Worst experience with taxes ever, and I have been using Turbo Tax for four years now. Importing your Quicken and/or Quickbooks data is a black box. I have no idea what it is including, not including, how it is calculating amounts, etc...



And then I had to change something and in order to do that I had to delete a whole form and start over. Don't get me started on having to pay for State filing and then being told that I can't file electronically (hence needing to make changes).

1 | four long days and nights Many time consuming problems with 2015 CD home and business. Have used TT for 10 years. At checkout TT gives you the option of saving as pdf file. DON'T do it. TT can't input pdf data into your next year's return. I found out the hard way this year. Had to recreate 2014 tax return by scratch.

 TT doesn't tell you how to save it as a *.tax file, the only data it CAN input. So if you want to lose your data from last year, go ahead and select the "save as pdf file" option.

 Also, the 2014 program incorrectly gave me depreciation on a business vehicle when it was FULLY depreciated the year before. So when I sold the vehicle this year, I had too much depreciation - TT wouldn't allow me to change the numbers and wouldn't let me complete my tax return due to their mistake. Two smart people at TT found an end run around this -- the only nice thing I can say about this 2015 experience.

 My final complaint - there's no obvious way to get thru to the bosses at Turbo Tax with suggestions/complaints as to what needs improving. Just this public forum. Not the same thing. TT can't carry over last years TT info | 64036011|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|322

1 | Absolutely no Support My experience on TurboTax started out well. It was quick and cheap. However, my tax return was rejected twice, based on my incorrect efile PIN or AGI. I tried both ways and got rejected again. When I called TurboTax, not only did the customer service agent question whether I was actually me several times (I am a female with a traditionally male name, not uncommon), but she was also, rude and didn't seem like she knew what she was talking about at all. I will never do my taxes this way again. I'd rather pay double what I paid and have actual support should something go wrong. Customer Service | 64035640|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|327
2 | Inadequate information before filing began. Inadequate pricing information before filing. 

Repetitious suggestions exert unnecessary, distracting, pressure to 'Upgrade' or miss additional deductions, access to filings, etc. My current income profile [senior with a dependent grandchild] qualifies me to file free. This information isn't shared until one has filed &, in my case, borrowed $59+ to pay the unexpectedly large bill.

 I believe this amount should be refunded. TurboTax tactics regarding upgrade pressure and information sharing are indicative of an ease with questionable business practices.

I'm uncertain if I'll be a returning customer or EVER recommend TurboTaxto anyone. Exerted repetitious pressures to 'Upgrade' or miss deductions, access to filings, etc. | 64035592|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|328
2 | Easy, till you have a problems with a 6 digit pin I had never done my taxes before. I got through everything easily enough. I liked that I could do it at my own pace and come back to it when I wanted to. It was pretty easy to understand and the explanations were good. My problem occurred when the 5 digit PIN that I was given wasn't accepted. my return was rejected. I verified and retrieved the pin again, but it still wouldn't work. Then I read that I should have a 6 digit pin being that I live in Georgia and it is a pilot program state for an identity theft security feature. I never received a 6 digit pin in the mail. The function was not working on the IRS website due to security issues. I couldn't get through to the irs. I had already paid via credit card. I was difficult at that point to figure out how to change to mailing the return. Mailing wasn't entirely clear what to include. I paid $119.00. I usually pay my accountant $240. I don't think it was worth all the aggravation and stress! E-filing is easy, but if you have a problem and have to file by mail, there are issues | 64035368|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|329

1 | Be sure you qualify for the free return If you are coming here thinking this will be free, turn away.

TurboTax doesn't exactly follow the way you might do things manually, and you may have trouble finding the info TurboTax wants. My 1099-R boxes didn't match up with the TurboTax version of it, and there were no explanations available. TurboTax doesn't handle some unique situations. The website also doesn't fully explain some situations or terms, requiring visits to other websites (non-Intuit) to get helpful info.

2 | Too Many Fees They do not give the max refund. They TAKE the maximum from your refund. $35 to PAY the $60 out of my refund?? Why? That's $35 dollars that could be in my gas tank. They advertise free federal, but then coerce you into a paid package, then charge for every other thing possible. I have used turbo tax for the past few years, but I will more than likely go to a tax office next year. They take less of your money in person.

Premium has NO free state efile. I still had to pay $27 to file my state return. If deluxe and premium are soo similar, why pay $30 more and still no state efile. Premium and deluxe both have same forms and both allow 5 federal efiles. Dont waste your money on premium. too many hidden charges | 64030245|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|346

2 |  I've used TurboTax for years, but this online version made me mad every step of the way. I don't remember being given the opportunity to buy the download version until after I'd paid for the online version, and then it wasn't clear whether I"d be charged twice. 



My return was rejected for an error in ID number entry, and when fixed, first I couldn't refile electronically, and then I could.

3 | very disappointed in program and customer service I have used TurboTax since it was first launched, and have used the Premier version for the past few years. Program this year was a big disappointment - i was unable to install on both my PC and laptop as I have in all past years. Customer service was not helpful; then one representative finally relented and said she would send me a download for the second computer - but she sent the wrong state program and NO ONE (supervisors included) was willing or able to correct the problem. I refused to pay a second time for something I had already purchased.

The program at times did strange things that I have not encountered before - for example, when trying to edit brokerage information, it entered a new brokerage account instead so I had to go back and redo things several times.

There is no good way to enter foreign income or pension and still retain the ability to file. Foreign entities do not - and are not required to - issue US type 1099's and W2's. After much searching, I did find a work-around from another user who had a similar problem. I was able to efile and hope that I have not created another problem by using this method.

A few years ago, TurboTax had a feature called "what if". I found this very helpful in trying out different scenarios, as well as for tax planning for the following year. I would like to see that feature again.

I am seriously considering using another tax prep program next year, even if I should have to re-type all carryover info. could not use on more than one computer, difficult to enter foreign pension, customer service not helpful | 64027530|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|358
3 | Update on TT experience e I just finished state and have additional comments, the transfer from Fed to State went very well and covered the necessary "bases". 



However, there are situations where the IRS does not require a field to be populated but TT flags the blank field as an error - even when their own text says it can be empty. If they miss this, what else might they miss.



Niggling editorial comment - why does TT switch from "No" on the left column to "No" on the right column (screen to screen). please be consistent - makes working through the forms easier.

3 | Need DL info? I went through the entire process of filing out the forms and filing... however, they needed my driver license info for some reason and since I was in the process of waiting for my new license (the current license was expiring and I had applied for a new one and got the temp license) I did not yet know my new license expiration date. So I filled out the rest of the online TurboTax forms and they gave me the "Congratulations" screen and let me print the forms and everything. I got the new license a couple of weeks later but I did not remember that TurboTax still needed that info before my taxes were filed correctly. So it was my fault but I wish they had done a better job of reminding me that I hadn't finished the filing process, ESPECIALLY as the Federal deadline was approaching. It wasn't until today (day after the deadline) that I checked the IRS site wondering why I hadn't yet got the refund, and my investigation brought me back to the TurboTax site where it looked like the process had not completed. I never got an explanation of why they needed my DL info and no notification that I was about to miss the deadline. I likely won't use TT next year.

2 | HOW TO Make Tax Day Less Painful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced a bill that would make doing taxes vastly easier for Americans — and would strongly push back against the tax prep industry's attempts to keep taxes difficult.



The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2016 would order the IRS to create a free online tax preparation and filing service comparable to TurboTax or other commercial programs. Moreover, it bans the agency from working with the tax prep companies, as it's been doing for years.



Currently, the IRS collaborates with tax software providers (mainly Intuit, which sells TurboTax) on what's called the Free File program. The program is supposed to provide free access to commercial software for low- and medium-income taxpayers. But because the eligibility rules are so complicated and the system is so poorly advertised, only 3 percent of taxpayers use it, and the National Taxpayer Advocate has repeatedly called for the program's abolition.



Warren's bill would kill the corrupt, feckless Free File program for good. But it goes further than that. Best of all, it establishes a new "return-free" filing option that would send millions of Americans with simple tax situations a pre-prepared tax return, which they can submit unchanged if they like.  | 64026086|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|367
1 | Good service, bad lobbying I really Turbo Tax for the convenience, but the fact that Intuit is lobbying to keep tax law complicated has made me decide to stop using this service in the future. If you have a good product, people will use it. You don't need to spend untold dollars in lobbying money to make sure that tax law continues to be a nightmare. This is particularly a problem because the Americans who suffer most from complex tax requirements are poor Americans. Intuit, why do you need to be part of the problem, aggressively so? It's disappointing, and I can't continue to give my money to a company that plays this corrupt game. Greedy company meddles in tax law | 64025919|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|368

2 | TY 2015 TurboTax Experience I've been using TurboTax for over 10 years. Usually, its a great experience. Easy, simple and convenient... However, this year was different. The self-guide questions, didn't simply address my issues and the help button or assistance wasn't as detailed or available for each entry. Even worse on the state tax forms... It was very vague on Traditional IRA Rollover determinations and partial early withdrawal penalty and income issues... Additionally, there was a glitch in the program that didn't allow me to purchase the Tax Audit Protection feature. I tried multiple times and it wouldn't take me to the credit card page to pay for it. Worse, the program would not let me proceed until I opted to cancel the purchase. I called the CSR # provided and had to wait 40 min and was hung up on. I then called back and after an hour was able to finally speak to a live person. Unfortunately, the CSR didn't know what they were doing, put me on numerous holds for minutes at a time and provided me wrong information and an incorrect phone number to call to purchase the product directly. I finally had to go online and find the Tax Audit Protection and pay for it separately. The experience was terrible, frustrating and very unlike what I've grown to expect from TurboTax and Intuit. Hopefully, next year will be better... If not, I'll have to find a better product elsewhere...

3 | tired of annoyances In the past year my husband and I bought a new home and our son bought a condo. In both cases we were getting mortgages. I was horrified that I couldn't print two years of taxes off my computer. Thankfully I am old school and keep paper copies. When you go to open an old tax return (more than current tax year old) TT says there is a new version of TT and you watch your prior tax return disappear. I've never filed an amended return, but I'm wondering how I would do that if I found some tax document from 2014!? 

Another annoyance is that I don't believe you can alphabetize your entries in a section. We have stock in over 40 companies. Some times they change, sometimes they get sold, sometimes they don't give dividends. What good is all of that history if it is no longer in alphabetical order because of changes over the years. What is worse is charitable contributions, because in that case it is over two hundred organizations. As the list of organizations we donate to has changed over the years that too has fallen out of order. That is a Real challenge to go through. Worse yet, as you scroll through, if you edit an item, when you flash back to the list they start you at the top again. I probably spend an additional 8-10 hours on my taxes because of these two sections not being in alphabetical order. old returns disappear after the new version of TT is out. can't alphabetize entries in dividends or charitable contrib. | 64019625|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|383
3 | Harder, less helpful than in the past I am less pleased with this software than in the past primarily because it gets more "robotic" (numbers in, decisions out without my participation or understanding why the end result is what it is.



 For example, for 2015, the software stated that the home office business deduction that I have taken in the past, was not allowed in 2015 - - but it did not state why it was not allowed. I read the help page in the software, and the home business expense deduction guidelines on the IRS site, and still do not understand why the deduction is not allowed. If your software knows the deduction is not allowed it should be able to tell me why - - what has changed since 2014 tax year. 

 

In past years your software has been a great "guide" that has lead me thru the process and allowed me to understand the reason for each action/decision. Just entering numbers and getting auto-results that I don't understand or agree with is anxiety provoking for me.

1 | Buggy and loopy Got stuck in an endless loop at the final/file step. Over an hour and half with support was fruitless.

Faced with increasing competition, it's hard to believe the product and support could be so awful. Bugs and loops. | 64019307|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|385
3 | Good product with challenges Usually TurboTax has been a stellar product over the years for me, but there was a bug that blocked payment for Audit Defense, which caused me to be late mailing my state tax return. Also, product is pricey when adding additional states, efiles and audit defense. Bugs paying for audit defense, expensive | 64018975|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|386
1 |  Last year when I filed with you, all I had to pay was $25 to file my states. This year, you raised your prices to a ridiculous amount and had the disingenuous manner of requiring me to upgrade at key points of the filing process after I had already spent hours entering information in. It's bad enough when I end up having to pay hundreds of dollars in taxes and even worse when the service I'm using is trying to extort hundreds more from me as I'm entering my information. 



This the LAST time I will use TurboTax and I will let others know to avoid it as well. Extorts me for money as I'm filing my taxes | 64018760|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|387
3 | Disappointed-Mac users BEWARE!!! This year's Turbo tax was a big disappointment. Although easy to understand the problem was that it would not let me download last year's tax info on my Mac no matter what I tried. I asked for help and even looked at the blogs which suggested to remove the encryption from last year's turbo tax which I did. I downloaded it and turbo tax 2015 said it received the information but as I did my taxes it was obvious it did not download last year's info. It took me much longer to do my taxes than it should have. "Turbo" it was not. Mac users BEWARE and consider another program if turbo tax doesn't fix this immediately. Not able to download last year's turbo tax info on my Mac no matter what I tried | 64018354|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|388
3 | Good but some niggling issues I've been using TurboTax for years but this year the version I chose seems to have lost some "support" for some capabilities. This is my first year to recieve a 1099MISC, early on in the income entry process it indicated that details regarding 1099MISC (expenses, deductions, etc) would be addressed later. It turn out that this 1099MISC is not automatically supported by the version I purchased and I needed to upgrade. They should have made this clear early in the process instead of misleading me. Turns out that I was able to do what was needed by manually editing the appropriate schedules and forms.



Also, I had to re-enter information for charitable donations several times - during the original entry and again during the review of the final forms. 

 

The "fix" issues process is "heavy weight". why can't I address all the issues (especially when several "fixes" are needed for the same element)? why do I have to rerun the check portion and do fixes line by line for the same deduction.



product capability was clearer with the 2014 packaging - go back to the old way please.

The only thing I didn't have was the pins number from 2014. Very frustrating. I didn't put the 0 in the AGI to refile because Turbotax said " Thanks "for you online e-file for last year 2014.

1 | 30 + years experience with TURBO TAX I don't recall when we started using TURBO TAX, but in 1986 when TURBO TAX recommended opening a SEP IRA for $8,000, we decided that we were always going to use TURBO TAX. Our experience in those 30+ years was excellent! 

>2015 was terrible - more trouble than in all of the previous 30+ years!

>Instead of asking if we still had the Schedule K-1s from 2014, TURBO TAX downloaded forms for all of the Schedule K-1s we no longer had. THAT TOOK A LOT OF "OVERRIDES".

>some how TURBO TAX downloaded our Scottrade brokerage accounts twice.

>We applied more than enough of our 2015 Federal refund to cover our 2016 estimated tax, but TURBO TAX printed 4 1040 ES Vouchers for less than we had applied to our 2016 estimated Federal Tax.

>When we tried to view the State Tax to credit part of our refund to our 2016 tax, TURBO TAX kept trying to get us to E file so we could our refund faster. It was a struggle, but by going to FORMS, we accessed the State Tax and were able to apply some of the State refund to our 2016 state tax.

The filing date is later for Iowa, but if this is not corrected in time for the Iowa deadline, IOWA DOES NOT ALLOW EXTENSIONS PAST ITS DEADLINE.



If I had not used Turbotax probably since its inception, I don't know how I would know how to do it. Program help and tax resources are lacking. State program does not seem to be worked out properly; at times it seemed as though you have to know how to do your state tax already and TurboTax was just a place to enter it. Error in program REQUIRES AN EXTENSION. Tax info/documentation and program help lacking. State return poor. | 64016484|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|400

1 | disappointed The advertisement stated that it was free and it ended up not being free and costing me almost $70 to get done which I do not have because all this money is owed to other people.... also it took me 4hrs to get done... next time I'll have a friend do it for me for FREE....

2 | my take We purchased a store copy of TTax and had difficulty coordinating the final payment process resulting in missing the filing deadline. Also spent two hours on phone with a rep with not much help due to the process of paying for the state which was indicated should have been included in the Deluxe version. Very frustrating.

1 | Greed The federal was only $115 & state $36 and we only end up getting $50. This is not a free service. It states $29.99 for state taxes & that's it but about $65 was deducted. Rip off.

2 | Heads Up I use Turbo Tax every year. It is simple to use, so I buy without concern for price or reading the box, because it's all I use. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I was very late in getting my taxes completed. We run two businesses, which involves my father-in-law, plus we have 5 children that are required to file, which I filed all 7 returns last year from my home & business turbo tax. I don't complain about all the fees at the end, as I can take care of things on my schedule from my home. However, when I finally got them all filled out this year, I wasn't able to E-file them all. I got the first 5 returns filed, then when go to do the 6th and 7th one, it says I'm sorry. I know this isn't what you want to hear at this point, but you need to go back and hit Print and mail your taxes in. Seriously, at the end of the program, you say sorry. Information that pertinent should've been at the beginning, when STARTING the 6th return, maybe stating, WARNING: you may complete this return, but only 5 may be E-filed!! So, at 9:00 p.m., when all post offices are closed, I am left scrambling to get 2 extensions filed. Thankfully, in Indiana, you only have to file a federal extension, as the state extensions were required to be mailed on Friday. Yes, after getting the box out and inspecting it, it does say that on the back, but who reads the box when this is what you've always used. Extremely frustrated, with much unneeded and unnecessary stress. Thanks! Only 5 Returns to be e-filed | 64013691|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|411

Going through the FED Tax, other situations path helped me enter the IP pin provided for myself only.

It should not go through to the e filing without asking users if they were provided such a PIN. A large chunk of people now gets those pins due to past issues, failed to ask for an IP pin | 64011741|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|416

3 | OK, better than manual input I've used the product for years and find it relatively easy to use. I don't like having to pay extra for the premier version to enter a few stock sales.

2 | Error didn't allow me to file on time There was an error if you imported the 1098 from the lender's website. In order to remove the error, you had to access "My Accounts". You are only able to on the full website on a computer or laptop. I tried to use it on my iPad but it wouldn't let me. Then I called the help line and the person could not help me.



I will probably not use Turbo Tax next year. It was NOT worth $90. My iPad wouldn't allow me to view the full website, which didn't allow me to fix an error in the system. | 64011450|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|421

This is the most stressful tax filing I've ever had. You made me late which has never happened before and you charged me 24.99 for filing my state when I specifically bought the Deluxe package for the extra price which claimed "free state download".

3 | Highs and Lows Entering my tax information was pretty easy, and I liked the interface. However, it was difficult to choose the product level I wanted (TurboTax's own directions on how to switch didn't work) and impossible to add my Mint discount - so it felt like I was forced into paying too much, $120 for federal and state. For that much money, I probably would have rather gone to an accountant and gotten more thorough answers to all of my individual questions. expensive; impossible to switch product levels; impossible to add discount | 64011023|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|427

1 | What in the world... I don't know who though it was a good idea to run this type of program where you stack up charges as a person's taxes are being complete but I did not appreciate being nickel and dimed. I choose to use Turbotax thinking I was saving money, I could have paid my preparer less money and it would have been less headache for me. I was thoroughly disappointed that the service charges started to stack up. There was no real clear indication that the end cost was going to be a hundred dollars. Please stop pulling people into this bullcrap about free taxes. It is so degrading. I used Turbotax years ago and I appreciated paying a flat fee for the disc and getting what I paid for. This was too much! Nope, won't get my money again. Especially when there are other services more reliable. I just want to know what I'm paying for and the cost. Just put that cost up front and let me decide whether I'd want to use your service. I felt nickle and dimed | 64010876|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|436

3 | Best Electronic Tax Program I have used TurboTax for years because of the ease of use and straight forward instructions. The only disappointment I find with TurboTax is the increased cost every year. I use your TurboTax for Home and Business every year because of the ease of use of the application and a consistently good product. But each year I find that TurboTax finds ways of increasing its price. Last year the price increased by 20%. I was surprised that the price this year was lower until I had to file and found that I now had to pay to file my State Income Tax. In all my previous years of using this product I never had to pay for state filing. NOW I realize that again, TurboTax has increased its price by about 15% over last year. Having to pay for State Filing was deceiving. It should have been noted more prominently on the packaging that electronic state filing was no longer free like the federal filing. Com'on TurboTax, be more truthful in your marketing. I guess this review should remove me from any chance at winning a "prize" from you. Please start thinking about the average tax payers who's wages have not increased in years and have a small business that is struggling to keep its clients and to pay their bills. Love your product very much but the increased cost will start to rival having to hire an accountant to do my taxes. You now have to pay for State Tax Filing | 64010744|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|451

Also, no alert to possible misinformation when it was clearly obvious that the same amt is entered on both lines of the W2 form, they want to sell you the $44.99 guarantee fee at the end which I nearly opted for but was able to figure out like seconds before midnight. Arggg

2 | Turbo Tax Rip Off Job Paid more at store for Premier version which supposedly included State return forms. However, at the VERY end I still had to pay an extra $25 to file my state return.

Foreign Tax Code C Line 2 col 3 "0."



Here, I have inserted "0", but the only accepted value is blank. TurboTax should be smart enough to evaluate "0" as blank and not stop me from filing my return. Or if I wish to file with the erroroneous 0 value, this should be allowed. Even when I went back and removed box 16, I still got this error. TurboTax should remove all worksheet entries if the box is removed. Overall, this "smart" check was very frustrating.

1 | underhanded returns to loyal filers Being forced to get the stupid card because paper check is not available unless paid with credit card is a joke. Charging 34.99 for the card is pretty much criminal when it's your only option. 29.99 for a "faster file" is a joke as well. It saved maybe 5min. Which actually helped due to last minute file on account of a down computer last night. Any other time though, that fee is a rip off and pretty much underhanded. Very appreciative way to treat loyal filers. Also the notice at beginning indicated there was 2 hours left to file. It took about 45min and at completion the date filed indicated April 19, 2019 2:58 a.m. I hope that isn't a factor. I don't believe I'll be using Turbo (get) Tax (ed) for my next year file. No filing fee listed at start so the 29.99 deal using last yr info seems ok. Then 29.99 & 34.99 added at end. Sneaky. | 64010710|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|457

1 | Fees automatically added When you remove the premium services it adds it back. I went back multiple times in different routes to remove the features, but it kept showing up in the end of the filing. Impressive business model forcing someone to pay for services that the customer does not want or need. We were actually able to take off premium services off of my girlfriends tax return but only after it tried to do the same thing. When we tried to tae it off of mine, it wouldn't let me. Frustrated customers for sure. Even when you remove premium services, it adds it back | 64010663|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|462
2 | deluxe package You have the same items in the premier, and you have it laid out easy enough to take a day to do. In the deluxe it is more difficult to understand and if I had not done 2014 with the premier , I would not have been able to receive a refund. I had to go back and forth to the premier to locate missing information. For the 1099INT you need to have all boxes available to see. It took days to find box4 because it was called unusual | 64010660|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|463
1 | Not satisfied with the fee I was charged Originally when I started doing my taxes.. I went with turbotax because of the discounts that were advertised.

1 | work to make taxes easier for us to complete Cute icons and snappy layout...cartoon-like...silly. Due to issues that could not be avoided this was a hard slog for me to complete.

Now is the time to exercise your influence to help consumers of your products. Your profits will not be effected. extraordinarily complex | 64010646|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|465

1 | Has Love of Money They keep trying to charge me for things that didn't make any sense and there were luxuries that I have no need for but it tries to get you to buy it, such as paying for turbotax with your return. My sister had to help me with not paying that.



I do not recommend this to anyone unless you're desparite. Also, with 12 W-2 forms, it's a pain in the rear. Can be extremely expensive | 64010611|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|468
2 | Disappointed I'm a long-time TurboTax user. I purchased the CD from Costco instead of downloading as in past since it was advertised that the state returns and e-file are included. To my surprise, I ended up having to pay the $24.99 additional fee to e-file as in past...although in past years I didn't have to pay for the forms download. Next year I'll probably use another program. 



Also this year I had a different tax situation due to a car accident. The instructions were not useful and the necessary calculation forms are not part of the process. I don't think this is even captured in the final review. limited data on casualty loss, fees to e-file | 64010599|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|469
3 | Stressful When it came down to filling out schedule to see I was not notified that it was mandatory I had to go onto the internet to figure out what I was supposed do. How to figure out why it was necessary the only thing that TurboTax told me was I don't help my deductions. I downloaded the TurboTax app and it ended up becoming the Deluxe app that I had to pay for then another charge for another $39 charge for something else. Once it noticed that I didn't fill out the information it did not tell me why what I needed to do where I can get this information from I was just lost and had to go on to the internet and figure out what it was talking about, looking at different sites to figure out what I was supposed to do how I was supposed to do it and why I needed to do it When it came down for me to fill out schedule C, it did not explain that it was mandatory to fill out | 64010595|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|470

2 | Hidden and extra costs = BAD Free, to $30, to $60, to $105, to try and sneak in another $40 so the fees are subtracted from my refund. All in all you advertise a "free" service then charge me almost $150 to file a 1099, 1099-k, and do itemized deductions, and state return. Just an excuse for me to pay someone else to do this work. Why get frustrated for almost 2 hours and pay $150? 



Finding the place for 1099-K filing was way too hard. Trying making that accessible without someone having to do a search for it, then go searching threw a few other screens to find it. pricing, available help, total solution that is not total | 64010555|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|473
1 | Greedy I had to file state taxes for two different states and was not only charged 29.99 two times for each state which i was fine with but was also charged another 34.99 to, from what I gathered, allow them to take the now 59.98 out of my tax return instead of paying it directly, this seems a bit greedy and is not specified initially when choosing the option, I dont recall having to pay this last year and if I did I didnt catch it. It makes me wonder how may people have unknowingly paid this fee, it doesnt seem like much but it took half my return and with thousands of people using this site im sure it adds up quick. Just seems a bit greedy is all. getting greedy turbotax | 64010552|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|474
3 | No E-filing for Federal ITR Extension?! Why is the Federal ITR Extension form be printed and mailed - and not E-filed like State? What is wrong with this system? When people are rushing to file their ITR on the last day - this is a pain! I was forced to file my ITR and pay everything with my credit card with all the fees because I do not have the money in the bank. I always thought that TurboTax was better than other software. Been using it for the last 10 years but with this glitch, it is mind-boggling why TT doesn't have this feature? Please amend this portion for the Federal ITR Extension to be able to E-file, otherwise, I may have to switch software. Why should Federal ITR Extension be mailed?! | 64010540|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|475
3 | Mixed Bag Overall, I like using the program and find most of its coverage easy to navigate and understand. However, there seem to be a number of overlapping sections that deal with business expenses and when "Other" Income can entered in the various sections, where 1099-MISC income may be reported, as well as the amount of business expense that is deductible under the various income tax areas. I found it a bit frustrating and confusing. Confusing information about Self-Employment, 1099-MISC, and business expenses | 64010533|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|476

1 | Last Year with TurboTax TurboTax has been getting worse each year, this was the worst. The review process finds problems that it doesn't explain, navigation is amazingly bad. Why do I have to click through questions I've already answered to get to something I skipped? Why do flags point to random pages instead of the pages where the flag was created? Worst of all are the surprise fees at the end. I ALREADY PAID $99.99 for this piece of c--p software, now, they want to take more at the last minute!!! Best of all, they say they will take that fee out of my federal return "for FREE" Isn't that sweet of Intuit!!

3 | Pros and Cons I do like how easy this process is. But the pricing is not as transparent as it should be. You start out clicking a button that says 'Free' (obviously not free) , then you find that filing state returns is an extra cost (ok), then you are hit with yet another fee for 'direct deposit'. I would hope that in the future Turbotax can find a way to be much more upfront about how much their service will actually cost.

3 | at least I got them paid I am a little frustrated. I did NOT want to pay my state taxes at this time, and I could not figure out how to make sure that I didn't. I needed to wait the extra couple of days for my paycheck so I would have the money in my account to cover them. I have always purchased the disc to do my taxes before and never had any trouble deciding when I would pay my taxes, so you can imagine why I am irritated. There should be a way to do this. I don't want to bounce my account, and, if the funds come out too soon, I will. I could not separate my state taxes so I could pay them later when they were due!!! | 64010493|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|483
2 | Beware of PLUS More I appreciate the ease and painless use of the website. I don't like how Turbo Tax slips in PLUS More at the end and justifies it by telling the user why it added it. I am sure it snuck it in somewhere in the middle of me paying more taxes then being relieved that I don't have to pay as much as I thought. I would like to be given a blatant sign saying from this point onward the $29.00 you thought you signed up for will be doubled. 

I'll have to not let my guard down next time.

3 | Foreign Tax credit and Schedule K-1 Schedule K-1 foreign tax credit asks if foreign tax was accrued (but no option for paid). So when I selected accrued, since no option for "paid", then TT doubled the foreign tax credit. Please add a tip sheet (hotlink) to tell mutual fund holders they cannot select both paid and accrued. e.g. 1099-DIV box 6 is labeled as foreign tax paid, and they should not select accrued for a simple mutual fund situation (passive income). Or add a tip sheet (hot link with a clear explanation if TT has no option to say either accrued or paid for Mutual Funds, Schedule K-1 foreign tax credit asks if foreign tax was accrued (but no option for paid) | 64010475|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|485
3 | a couple of hiccups Paying for State return was a surprise. I purchased Turbo Tax for $55 (Deluxe) and have done this for the past 10 yrs, and it's always included one free State. This time I had to pay $24.99 extra to e-file my State. That means I had paid $80 to file my tax return this year, plus $24.99 to do the e-file. That's a grand total of $115. 10 yrs ago I paid less than $40 to file both Federal and State. I think it's time to switch to a professional tax preparer. TurboTax is gettting too expensive. Schedule K-1 needs more instructions. | 64010470|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|486
2 | traded speed for gimicks It wouldn't download my financial records with the online version. Told me to use the CD app instead. That didn't work either though it got a little further. Ended up having to do the transactions by hand.. and that took a while!!



Lots of times the app was slow as it recalculated every single time I entered a number. This was extremely annoying when you have hundreds of entries to go through (see above). Then after it did the math it would animate the refund amounts going up or down. That took even more time. How about you do that AFTER all the hundreds of records are entered and not waste 10-15 seconds after I enter each entry. slow and limited | 64010461|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|487
2 | Good but not on Deadline Day I have used Turbotax for the last 3-4 years and I have been very happy with the application and service. However, this year, while the interface was great--the server was extremely poor. I spent 3 hours trying to finish a few minor edits in my taxes because the program kept disconnecting and freezing. I've transmitted on deadline day before and did not experience this enormous delay. I was not even able to make the deadline. I hastily filed for an extension and I do not know if I filled it out properly because of the speed needed to complete it. I am now very worried about the status of my return and whether I will be approved for my refund. Even more, I am getting married and need all the extra funds I can get. server was very poor prior to deadline | 64010455|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|488

2 | Hidden charges ruined a great tax filling porocess I was delighted with the new program. It was user friendly and well designed. However, my "Simple Form" which was offered for free was charged way too much! I agreed to the $29.00 fee twice. How did $29.00 + $29.00 dollars turn into a $94.00 total?! I am very upset that I was not given an explanation or a chance to review what the additional charge is for. I quickly went from a delighted customer to a disgruntle customer. $94.00 in processing fees is outrageous. I have never had to pay such a large amount. I will use a different system next year.

1 | suprise charges at the end--not cool I've used turbotax for years and have always been used to paying 70-80 for an individual filing. I did not appreciate the fact that prices were spiked and a protection was added though I kept declining it. 130.00 charge deserves me to actually meet with a human tax person and pay the same rate, but attain a human interaction. I will not be using this next tax season.

3 | Foreign Tax credit Interview questions should be clear if it wants foreign sourced income or foreign sourced QDI for mutual funds. Then more confusion is added when LTCG is added into total foreign income (div and LTCG ?). Is LTCG related to foreign tax paid ? Please add a tip sheet (hotlink) for Mutual funds on what boxes to use on form 1099-DIV and for what percentage or income definition to ask the mutual fund companies re: foreign taxes paid and foreign income needed in Turbo Tax. Service reps at MF companies don't understand what TT interview questions are asking. Thank you, Interview questions should be clear on foreign sourced income or foreign sourced QDI for mutual funds. | 64010386|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|500

3 | turbo tax not too turbo! I have used turbotax the last 7 years. It is very convenient to pull up your taxes whenever needed on a site. It is also easy how they transfer all your info to the next year. If you change your job or your money has changed it can be time consuming and frustrating to start from beginning again. It is hard to try to transfer all your info to another site when turbo has all your info and wont give it to you unless you will pay. it is not free.

1 | Tried to Rip Me Off! I did not appreciate not being informed of the charges that came with choosing the option to get my fees deducted from my refund. I had specifically chosen to NOT use the Premium benefits and when asked what method of payment I wanted to use (1. Pay with Credit Card or 2. Deduct fees from Federal Refund) there was no notice saying that they were automatically adding the Premium benefits charge to my services after I had specified that I did NOT want them.  | 64010366|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|503

I tried getting help prior to spending a good 2 hours trying to fix it myself through the forms, but ended up waiting an hour on hold before having to hang u because i had to pick up my son. The issue was with paid family leave I checked that box and it took my husbands enter income and made it PFL, which completely messed up my State taxes. I went in and corrected it but it would not correct it, I even went completely through it again and nothing changed.

I could be very mistaken, but I don't remember being required to upgrade to the $105 plan JUST to file my 10-99!! Very frustrating. It is quick and relatively painless otherwise, but I know how to file my own taxes. I know what portions of the form I need to fill out, etc. but I am on TurboTax for the convenience of it. I know that I will owe taxes, so this whole "you can just deduct the cost out of your refund!! :D " doesn't actually work for me. Just let me file my 10-99 for free. Please. Constant Upsell, Unable to File 10-99 without Paying, Feels like Scam | 64010244|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|519

2 | Not free This program ended up costing me $130 after all the added fees. I filed a w-9 and 1099 and another fee for using my bank account to direct deposit the money. Wrangled me in for the free tag | 64010239|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|522
2 | Overpriced. No better than cheaper alternatives... I gave up on TurboTax about 10 years ago and started using some of MUCH cheaper alternatives. Last year, I found that I had a couple of significant questions which I was not able to find easy answers for with those other software packages. Consequently, I resolved to give TurboTax another shot this year in the hopes that it would provide much more clear explanations thereby speeding up my tax return preparations. 



Sadly, I found TurboTax2015 to be no more informative than the software that I'd been using when it came to providing background information. I gave up trying to find answers in the help and found that google provided much faster answers. As an additional insult to their customers, they charge $25 to e-file with the state when it is FREE! I ended up WASTING even more time transferring information out of TurboTax into the interface for my state's FREE E-File interface. 



Nice job TurboTax. You are the MonsterCable of tax preparation software. You charge for a premium package but don't actually bring ANY additional value. It took me longer to prepare my tax return this year than when I used other packages.



I will not be using your product again. OVERPRICED, not much actual guidance that isn't FREELY available online and from the IRS itself | 64010229|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|523

1 | No Refund - I had to pay over $500 I had to create a new account midway and clear and restart because the results didn't make sense - an practically every

time I restarted it was giving different results.



My impression is that the software is all messed up.



The phone consultant did not give a satisfactory explanation. Can't explain why my $6500 Roth IRA contribution didn't have an impact towards giving me a refund | 64010221|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|525
1 | HIdden fees and broken card payment The website gave me the unmistakable impression that filing my federal returns would be free, but because of one deduction that I'm still unsure of the exact nature of they demanded that I upgrade to a deluxe account for 55 dollars! Mind you they didn't say this until I had already filled out all of my forms. 

And worst of all, after that the credit card payment screen wouldn't accept my card that I routinely use for online purchases, and they demanded I "upgrade" again just so they can charge their exorbitant fees straight from my tax return! It's completely outrageous! 



0/5 stars, will never use again. DO NOT USE THIS "SERVICE" Basically my whole experience | 64010220|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|526

Asks for credit info and personal data and then starts to ask questions for which there is no entry needed or info to provide...I DID NOT NEED a K 1 filed this year.

3 | Not what I expected If you elect to mail in your federal tax due on your own, turbotax automatically sets you up with voucher(s). I elected this option and they printed six vouchers with a set amount of payment. I didn't get to elect what I wanted to mail in. What if I am mailing the full amount owed?? Now I am stuck with a voucher with an incorrect amount. And is this reported to the IRS?? It doesn't make sense for turbotax to predetermine an amount that you may or may not be able to send. If you elect to mail your federal tax due turbotax automatically sets you up with a voucher(s) several. | 64010204|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|528

3 | Disappointed Not sure why Turbo Tax suggested I pay the premium rate. This was not something I needed. I thought it was to allow for my state return to be filed in addition to the federal but I had to pay another fee for that. Very disappointed. Probably would have been even more upset if I had to pay taxes which is what Turbo Tax originally showed. I had to do some research because I could not believe I was about to have to pay over $1000!!! Which I did not have, different problem! Turbo tax should have picked up that I have a rental home and that I did not account for depreciation for my house in the assets. Disappointed :-( I was going to have to pay over $1000 if I did not do my own research. I paid too much for a service I did not need | 64010184|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|530
1 | WORSE EVER I have used turbo tax for over ten years and this year's experience was horrible. The program forced me to use a higher valued package than normal. Made me pay for it only for me to have to file for an extension because of problems with data entry in the end. Turbotax had already charged me even though I was unable to e-file. Turbo tax also had higher rates but I was reluctant to use anything else bc all of my information was stored with turbotax. Never again. LIVID. GREEDY | 64010172|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|531

2 | Don't want to pay for "why" You tell me I owe the govt money, yet you do not tell me why. You have this info readily available, yet you hide it and want me to pay extra to see it. 



Your unwillingness to provide me with an explanation is harmful to my peace of mind and just feels wrong. I don't need live support, just a succinct written explanation. 



These tax calculations are very important, and if I am to pay you $50+ extra just to get a basic understanding, I may as well go to a tax preparer. I'm sure it's a simple explanation, why hide it and cause your customers anxiety? 



In short: do not charge extra for the "why". You will lose my business, along with anyone else who does not want to be nickel and dimed just to get a basic explanation. lack of explanation | 64010156|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|535
1 | Not Happy This is my 6th year of using Turbo Tax and I won't be using it next year. Despite using the Premier Version, Turbo Tax didn't take me through a simple sale of property without having to research it extensively and call support re correct forms. When it came time to file, the program was glitchy and kept repeating error messages. Tech support was lengthy and not very helpful. They finally decided that form 593 couldn't be e-filed in State of Ca, which should have been determined at the beginning. Instead I wasted hours and hours on Turbo Tax. Going to a CPA would have been more effective.

easy to use but when it checks it it does not explain how to fix it.



I wnat to be able to click on a hyperlink that tells me just where to look for the answers to each specific question and how to be sure it is correct as well as where to put it.



The software did not tell me I had 2 vehicle forms and did not tell me to delete 2 other forms I did not need. It just kept asking the same unanswerable questions over and over and this blocked me from efiling my taxes. when it checks it it does not explain how to fix it | 64010123|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|541

1 | Unhappy with State Individual LLC filing There were several times when Turbo Tax kept implying that I would also have to purchase Business - but then flipped and said no, okay for Home and Business, Unclear, and deceptive. 

1st the 568 form filings were more complex than the State said I had to do for a single member. 2nd the directions by Turbo Tax were confusing and random. 3rd. If I need to file a 568 and 3522, then I expect it to be done with Turbo Tax along with the payment for it would be included in the Turbo Tax process, but you don't so now I will probably miss the deadline and have to pay a penalty because you were not clear, and not complete for a business filing. Ca FTB says I am required to e-file and you are now forcing me unexpectedly to mail. Incomplete Filing | 64010114|0|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|543

1 | Don't upgrade turbotax Always use only the free turbo tax. They will charge you more but offer exactly nothing additional. Free federal, pay for state and be done.

1 | Really turbo? I've filled with turbo tax many times. I've never paid to itemize and couldn't get my state refunds without paying a ridiculous amount. For the price I'd have to pay I'll be better off going somewhere else and just dropping them off. Same pay and no headache of doing them myself.

1 | Bait and switched Baited and switched all the wat. What was supposed to be free ended up costing $170. I had no other option as I had wasted hours with this service and was forced to file on the 18th due to a paperwork error on behalf of my employer. I travel to many states due to work and need to file in two or more usually. Each state cost $40 and my federal ( the free one?) cost $55. The rest you ask? $35 processing fee for them to take it directly from my refund!! I could have handed my paperwork to an accountant for that and not wasted all my time on this scam. My opinion, do it yourself with efile (as I have every other year) or pay an accountant to save yourself this head ache. Ended up taking hours, couldn't file until I purchased upgrade, fees started piling up. | 64010061|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|550
1 | Dear idiot software programmers, Definitely a rip-off of $50 after this experience with TurboTax and then requiring me to be on the phone almost 1.5hr with someone, so i missed the midnight deadline in FL...oh why? because I was entering my ID as reqd on mobile, then on desktop, and as I am in FL, IDs contain hyphen (do a google photo search), yet NOWHERE on mobile, or desktop does it say anything about not including hyphens or other characters if theyre a part of the number. YOU PEOPLE ARE FKG IDIOTS....1 SIMPLE " *do not include hyphens or other characters " under the box wouldve allowed me to file this on time before 12 without a phone call, etc, etc....instead....THAT was the only problem. IM FILING TAXES, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE LEGAL LONG NAME, ID, ETC ETC. Dear idiot programmers with NO common sense, how about you let a 3rd party look at the website next time you try to program BEFORE you release it? Or is user friendly not a concept youve ever heard of? ITS SIMPLE STUPID MISTAKES LIKE NOT INCL MY SUGGESTION, for example, THAT WASTES TIME, ANGERS PEOPLE, CAUSES YELLING AT PHONE REPS, AND MAKE PEOPLE NOT WANT TO USE OR RECOMMEND YOUR SERVICE AGAIN. USE SOME COMMON SENSE!!!!!!!! I for 1 will NOT be using or recommending anyone EVER use TurboTax. What a waste of $50. Ill gladly use another service, maybe even pay a little more, next year if the service/software is actually aimed at the user for quick and easy filing. That is all, thank you.

Why the federal filing is free but state filing costs money I don't know, but I don't believe I saw anything about a price for such until about the end of the program. I understand as a business you need to make money, but I wish TurboTax was more upfront and were to present a modest fee in the beginning instead of playing up "the free and easy" image as they do.

2 | Not Good to Use this year! I will not use this method again. It would cost me less to just purchase my own software. The State is included and your not forced to accept or refuse MAX product.

2 | fees I am not very happy that when we returned to turbo tax, there was a new $30 fee just for keeping the old personal info. Then, got to the end and it was going to charge an additional $35 for holding payment out of federal return. This would have been $95 total on a $239 return.

3 | Don't Look Back I found Turbo tax unnecessarily difficult and confusing to make changes to data once entered. The state tax exemption area (including major purchases) and the college expenses area were difficult to return to. Also the page showing an overview of income included college fund payments under "other income" even though these weren't computed into my taxable income, and so presented a confusing picture of my income in review. 



On the other hand, the overview of my tax form under the "Tools" tab was clear and useful and cleared up the questions I had about how amounts I was entering computed to taxable income and credits.

1 | too expensive / hidden costs Even if you made next to nothing, if you have 1099 forms they make you upgrade. Further, if you would like to deduct office expenses you have to upgrade even more.

3 | Windows 10 NO HELP Each year the Home & Business gets better. Known what can be deducted and where to put the deductions can be hard for a small business owner. But this year, TurboTax was working at a disadvantage in that Windows 10 decided to do an upgrade in the middle of tax season that slowed down the way that TT worked and the overall ease of working with TT. Every time I had a new calculation, or went to the next page, I had to retrieve TT from the task icon because the Windows 10 Desktop came up! I also ran into a section where if there had been math in the example it would have helped figured out what the IRS was asking for. This about the FMV Before and After the event of Theft or Destruction, was not clear if FMV at time after destruction or at time of replacement after destruction. Some of the examples needs to have math in them to better illustrate the results wanted. | 64009919|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|571

Our taxes have never been complicated. They were always as simple as type in the information and hit send. Never had to calculate anything to figure anything out. If I wanted to spend this amount of money I would go to a professional and not have to worry about doing them myself. Its supposed to be cheaper to do them yourself, not cost you more!

I will also bad mouth your service and tell everyone I know how you ripped me off charging me two different charges of 49.99 and 39.99 and in the end it totaled to 124.97. Rip offs are what you are. I could have went to a private person and paid less. Never again will I file with Turbo Tax and I know a lot of people who I work with, family, friends and social media friends and associates who I will spread the word about Turbo Tax.

Was supposed to be free for Federal and it would have been nice to have warnings that state would have been extra with extra fees tacked on. I am a widow, I do not think i was given all the breaks I should of had. It was very difficult to file social security for my children. I will NOT recommended this to anyone.

2 | Pay or no guarantee of best refund It should be free and easy to pull up previous years tax info.

3 | Very Useful Software but Payment seems Underhanded I find it very helpful to be able to use the TurboTax software and think it does an excellent job guiding through the tax return process and explaining some of the more difficult elements.



My only complaint (and it's a rather big one) is that it's very unclear when different payment packages are selected and if an option is chosen it's apparently impossible to change it. I thought I'd be paying the the $39.99 to file a State return (which would have been money well spent and I'd be happy to do it), but somehow I ended up signed up for a "Deluxe Package" and a "Premium Package" on top of this with a total that ended up costing over $120. I couldn't figure out how to go back and change it, so my options were to either bite the bullet and pay, or start filing all over again by some other means. I bit the bullet this year, but I may try another tax program next year to see if they are more transparent with how they charge. Very difficult (to the point of being sneaky) to figure out what or when I am paying for something until it's too late | 64009871|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|582

1 | End of 25 years of using Turbo Tax After over 25 years of using Turbo Tax, I'm going with a different option next year. It's too late for me this year as I already paid in order to file. The forced upgrade to Deluxe at the end for having a measly foreign tax credit is tricky. I was then hoping to offset that cost with the 10% Amazon gift card bonus which I received last year, which wasn't there nor were any bonuses. Other tax filing companies offer bonuses which I will take advantage of next year and recommend others to do the same. I apologize to everyone I recommended TurboTax to this year for the Amazon 10% gift card bonus which you aren't aware is missing until after you pay. I did an internet search on this and I'm definitely not alone. Tricky upgrade to Deluxe and zero benefits | 64009835|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|586
3 | Costs and Benefits Not Very Well Explained I've been using TurboTax for years, but every year I get less and less pleased with the upselling. I get they have to make money, especially when they allow users to file for free if they fill out everything themselves. I started a business last year and made no income from it last year, but they made it seem like I should most definitely buy their premium business package, regardless of how little I would need to fill out if I did it myself. I was convinced, but regretted it. Of course they then make it too much effort to start over from scratch, so I went with it. Then they hid the $35 upcharge for having their fees deducted from my return within an ad for yet another upcharge that I could add if I wanted to. I didn't notice until right before I clicked to submit. I ended up paying with my credit card to avoid that exorbitant fee for simply taking my money at a very small convenience. Doesn't make it easy to understand what you're paying for | 64009831|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|587
2 | Not so happy I went through the return, then the software recommended I upgrade for maximum refund. Since you are not obligated to pay prior to filing, I tried it. The upgrade did nothing for me. I tried to go back to the original version of the software that I used, but I could not unless I deleted EVERYTHING and started over. So overall, I lost an additional $100 by trying the "recommended" software. Upgrade didn't help and I actually lost money | 64009810|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|588
2 | Dissappointed TurboTax should charge a percentage of the return and not a flat amount by forcing customers to sign up for benefits which they do not want. Being charged more than $60 minumum to file when your refund is only $81 seems unfair and somewhat like a scam. Charged me much more to file than what I'm getting in my return: | 64009801|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|589
1 | Beware, It is not all free Advertised to be free from IRS website but it is actually not. $104 charge. You should goto a tax preparer and save you some time and stress to figure Turbo tax It was advertised to be free but was not | 64009771|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|590
3 | extra cost adds up apparently ≤100 of capital gains put me in a higher tax bracket, requiring me to upgrade to a more costly version of Turbotax, (for one extra form) and added $380 to my taxes. the K-1 I received did not match the TT format, so for a nominal loss, I spent more money and time than it was worth. Although TT is not all to blame, it would be nice if the extra costs were prorated by the number of additional forms required and if the tax increase was explained by a chart, rather than just providing an amount. Obviously, it can be checked at the IRS site, but it would be nice if it was referenced within the software. K-1 confusion | 64009766|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|591
3 | Not impressed I have used TurboTax for years and always recommended it to my friends. Now it is cheaper for me to use an accountant. I am not sure why I would ever use this service again.

3 | more complicated and more expensive online it showed discounted rates, but when I was finished it charged me more than regular price.

3 | No E-filing of Extension in TurboTax I have a love/hate relationship with Turbo Tax. Each year I have greater difficulty in finding the actual place data was entered when I find I need to make changes. It also seems to force you to revisit a lot of questions that were previously answered, as the only way to get to a place to make a change. No E-filing of Extension in TurboTax; it seems to have less helpful information in the "Help" function each year | 64009727|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|595
1 | NEVER purchase TurboTx again after yrs of loyalty I cannot recall the last time I have been this upset filing taxes!! WHAT happened to TurboTax, the program we faithfully purchased through our USAA acct, year after year? New management?? 

Something drastic and incredibly negative has taken place!

Not to mention the disappointment I am experiencing in a product I have trusted for so long but in the poor performance as well! Horrible experience ....this will take sometime to recover from, my blood pressure is soaring I'm sure! and additionally....the product I initially signed on for, changed when it came time to pay (magically more expensive) AND would NOT ALLOW me to go back and fix the unauthorized so called "upgrade" the program changed on its own!! 

Nothing (without exaggeration) NOTHING on this program went smoothly....I should have stopped, DUMPED TurboTax and moved on....what a mess!!! Finally, adding insult to extreme injury....the dang thing simply WOULD not allow me to find a route around using my credit card to pay for the program, why NOT! I paid my nearly $8000. tax debt from my checking acct....SO why did the program insist on making me pay the $64.99 on my credit card! You folks need to sit back in the coming months and get your act together before everyone flocks to other means of tax prep! 

I'll be shaking my head for quite some time on just exactly what happened to cause such a fine respectable company to go sour.....more like ROTTEN!!!

3 | Turbo Tax Premier 2015 Issues Been using Turbo Tax for years and have not been as frustrated as this year. Always an issue is the number of questions that are never answered. Would be nice to have a subject forum like "Turbo Tax 2015" where there is one place to look for problems etc. Now I have to submit questions or a string of words and hope that some of the questions and answers found relate to what I was asking. Secondly, why does TT ask me to input my bank information when it obviously has it already? And why wouldn't TT accept 04/18/2016 as a valid submission date? I had to put in 4/15 to get my taxes e filed. I hope that it goes through.

Also on the interview for Rental property: there is a question asked about when you acquired a rental property. Then when TT reviews your information, the date pops up as when the property went into service. Those can be two very different dates.



Also, it seems to me that the printing of your tax returns are all the same option (you get everything) no matter what you choose in the drop down menu. The Health Entry Sheet also besides the entry problem, also puts in everything on the bottom (name, SSN etc) that the form says NOT to put down there.

3 | TurboTax Review Normally the help is really good, but this time was much more difficult. My questions were not answered and I don't feel comfortable with my filing for state tax.

3 | Blew it again -- one-word names are legal TurboTax and IRS still cannot get together when a filer has a single name (no last name). Software has yet to be fixed. After I e-file, IRS rejects with NO LAST NAME. If I switch my name to be the last name, then it's rejected by the IRS because of NO FIRST NAME. Somebody in this chain-of-responsibility must have a bulb burned out, and nobody seems to care, because this happens every year. I always end up having to print and mail my return.

1 | Not as advertised I filed using TurboTax last year, it was completely free. I tried it again this year and got all the way to the end and had to pay $29.99 to file. Real nice TurboTax, I will not be using this again to file. Wasn't free | 64009654|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|602
1 | Big Con Game When Filing wth State While Turbo Tax makes my own tax filing easier, I think it is a big rip off when I file my college student's taxes. Since she goes to Princeton in NJ, I have to pay close to $50 extra to do her state taxes. Then I am charged $28 more dollars to e-file them to NJ. It really is expensive and a ripoff. Ended up paying about $75 extra to file my daughter's NJ taxes. | 64009653|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|603
2 | Good product, but too expensive now. I have used TurboTax for over 10 years. However, next year I intend to use another online tax service due to cost. I had to use the $79.99 service this year because I had a meager earning from a partnership. I could have saved half (or more) using another of the many services available. My return just is not complex enough to justify paying that much for online filing. Sorry, but you've lost yet another (previously) loyal customer. Fees have increased to beyond justification for my purposes. | 64009648|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|604

2 | Easy to Use - Pricey to Choose! TurboTax, as always, is very easy to navigate, provides plenty of helpful information and suggestions on lowering your tax burden. I wasn't happy with the increase in pricing this year. I paid over $90 to file my taxes and could have done it for less than $40 elsewhere. The premium price just isn't worth it.

2 | Turbo Tax Online is not Great I've used Turbo Tax CDs for years but used the online version for the fist time this year. ONLY because I could not buy and download the business version from the website.

It was easy enough to use, very similar to the CD version, but you can not do multiple returns. Also navigating the website itself is not intuitive. Can't do multiple returns | 64009626|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|607

3 | changed a lot this year I have used turbo tax for the last 10 years and always felt good and confident about it. This year much less. It did not explain many of the terms I did not understand in their context such as "at risk" Also I had trouble this year with information from last year not carried forward such as closing inventory last year and ending mileage from last year. Overall it was just not the easy fill form it used to be. Seemed very confusing this year | 64009611|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|609

In order to file on time I went ahead but this is a scam part of what I have believed for years was a reputable company.

3 |  I enjoy the simple questions, explanations of the sections, and that the software does the calculations. I've used the product for many years but the ease of the interface and intuitive navigation that I've learned to expect in the product took a step back this year from previous versions. For example, it was frustrating when I needed to reprint a form to be sent in that all of the documents had the Preview Only watermark with no option to remove it. I had to search for a workaround so I could print my own document; I ended up having to reopen a new state filing. It had to be anticipated that users would have to go back and reprint these documents, why wasn't there an option to turn this watermark off or on? I also did not like having to go through all of the questions of a section if I only needed to go back and update 1 item. Once a section is complete, the user should be able to select which item they want to update within a section. I was also not able to download my information entered into turbotax from last year, apparently because I had used a CD version previously and saved my information to my PC and not online like this year. This was easy enough to retype, but was annoying. I'll use the product again next year as I still think it is the best there is on the market, but I hope the software takes positive steps forward with the interface and navigation with the 2016 tax version. 2015 version lost past software interface and intuitive navigation ease | 64009507|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|616
3 | A step in the wrong direction I have been using TurboTax since 2009 and had always had a great experience until this year. To begin with it took longer to install and I was having issues with MAC OSX, it prefers Yosemite +. While I know I need to upgrade to Yosemite, I would have expected TT to still work well with older OS versions, especially considering that those of us who have used software for many years have older electronic returns somewhere on our hard drives that we may need to access, and you would think someone thought about that. Once I was able to install and I worked on my taxes I encountered a major and severe delay when trying to enter the information for my healthcare plan which is a new requirement under the Affordable Care Act. I tried to restart and did not work, I found a note on the TT website that suggested to restart, but first erase all turbotax/Intuit content from Cache on the browser and that seemed to work. At least after doing that I was able to enter the information from my 1095 form, however it froze again after I entered info and as I tried to go to next step. It did save the information, but I had to go through same process of cleaning the Cache and restarting laptop since I wanted to make sure all I entered was saved. The weird thing is that while it seemed to hang on the health insurance information tab, the software could still work on the other areas such as deductions, income etc. My last beef was with processing a NOLA on my return, this was a first for me, and while TT does allow you to do this, it does not have a lot of information on the implications of NOLAs, which is important since you only have one opportunity to make a decision to carry-back or carry-forward a NOLA. This was one time where professional help would have probably been best. I am not sure if I will use TT again next year. It had been great in the past, but we shall see in the future. Encountered some bugs, especially in the healthcare information area. The program got stuck in processing this area. | 64009504|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|617

3 | Less user friendly that last year's version This year, the TurboTax user interface seemed to less logically follow the standard method of reviewing and editing topics in an orderly fashion. Once in a topic, the path(s) taken by the software could be different depending on how you entered the topic and whether you had been there previously. Once filled out, it was difficult to navigate back and forth if something needed to be modified. It would help the user greatly to have a pictorial of the summary values in each topic that are editable, rather than having a single number and forcing the user to click through menu after menu to try and find the info needed. Some of the forms ask questions that were already filled out, but don't show what was previously entered and prompt the user to fill out again. It is too easy to enter something different the next time. And if the user has to do the return offline to keep track of what is entered, maybe it's just as easy to keep track of it in another software program.



One of the best things about the TurboTax software is probably something that could be said for many of the tax packages that are used year after year - the ability of the software to remember the returns of last year, pull up recently used forms to be used again, and use previously entered personal information, saving significant time filling out the more mundane forms.



Deleting forms from the previous year that will not be used can be a challenge. The forms are automatically created, but if they won't be used, the user must know and actively search out and delete. Fortunately, instructions for this were contained in the help section.



Anything that causes a problem with the forms, and are out of the menu for filling the forms will cause the program to hang-up and not allow the return to be filed electronically. Although I understand that this needs to be this way for the appropriate submission of returns to eliminate errors, it leaves very little to no flexibility for filling out the forms. One common example is if the EIN of a dependent care provider is unknown, immediately, the form is unable to be electronically submitted. This can be very frustrating. Have to overtly delete forms carried over from previous years. More difficult to navigate than in previous years. | 64009463|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|620
3 | Quick and somewhat easy Return was going well until the end where I see I was charged $94 after expecting around $40-45. This was unexpected and clearly structured this way so people simply click and 'whatever' I'm in too deep now...and TurboTax gets extra fees. Really too bad because I've been a customer since 2007 and fully trusted them until this return. I will be looking for an alternative site to file next year.

2 |  To be honest, as you have asked, I don't think that it is fair that I was due only $26.00 from state and I was charged $29.99 to file my taxes with VA. This is crazy, it seems that if you have to charge a fee, that it would be parameters with this , example if you made less than ...there would be no fee. I am filing my taxes for the first time, and this is very disappointing for me as I an technically in the hole for my tax refund. As an example above this review where it says rocked my refund, my refund feels ripped, ,no rocking here...feel sad.  | 64009395|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|628
1 | Lawsuit comin down the rail! The latest turbotax system is EXTREMELY REDUNDANT and the Software is faulty. this is the third year turbotax made me change my password after ive put in the same password every year. WAY TOO MANY useless pages, you guys gotta dial down asking the same exact questions endlessly and them reviewing endlessly. out of 106 pages there was to click through (carpel tunnel, thanx alot) only 16 of them was where any real filing was done, in the end it hurts your company the worst because of all the useless data flow turbotax should have to spend funding on. the login stage is bugged, tell the source file programmers they still didnt fix last years problem, or the year before that (mind you, i did all 3 years' taxes on 3 different computers, thats why i couldnt use turbotax last year. 



Your advertising said it was quick, when yet it took me almost 6 hours just to file ONE W-2, this is Pathetic and UNACCEPTABLE in the business world or any other. Furthermore with programming, every option to have a message sent to my phone number to aid my filing FAILED to route the such, no texts. and why do i need to enter ALL of my information 20 to 30 times on the SAME WEB SIGHT (FAULTY!!! tell your R&D dept to PLEASE design with efficiency). when i babysit my nephews and my niece i only have to tell them something once, the oldest is 6, how old are you guys? long story short, what im trying to clue here is that Identity theft happens because information is FAR too loosely shared online, any hacker sees this as opportunity to take ALL of someones information. Make sense? if not, ask and I'll explain fluently, just call, and ill wave the lawsuit. id type in my number but you guys already have it 30 times over, so FIGURE IT OUT!!!! and dont have a helpless intern make a sympathy call, i wont drink it, i want the call from man in charge (if there even is one behind this). otherwise, ill hand you over to my attorney, he understands and RESPECTS efficiency very well.



Stop listening to focus groups and listen to Your People. call me, you got the number Too many reviews, too many pages of the same questions, not quick like Advertisin FALSELY suggests, oh just read below | 64009394|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|629
2 | Surprise fee The Green Dot Bank "Processing Fee" at the end was an unpleasant surprise. Enough that I won't use Turbo again. For about the same $$ of that fee and the state filing fee I could have gone to H&R Block.

3 | A bit unexpected on the charges When signing up for your services it sait I could use the plus for $29.99 and then when filing I saw that it too was $29.99. Ok I understand you don't work for free so nonploblem. To my understanding I am going to be paying $29.99 +$29.99= $59.98



When I am completing my return it tells me that I got my refund minus fees turbotax state for 29.99 which had agreed to

 But then it said $64.59 I think for the remaining fees for a total of $94.58. This is much higher then the $59.98 that I had agreed to pay to process my refund.



I didn't have an option to go back to these points unless I wanted to start over which was not possible. So I had to accept these conditions. Didn't expect the amount of fees to process | 64009376|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|633

Couldn't get your donation app to work~ again! I've NEVER been able to get it to work

You should say ON THE BOX and in the beginning you are going to charge MORE $ to file.

Not likely I'll use Turbo Tax again

3 | Pretty Easy Overall pretty easy. Better than paying outrageous Tax Preparer costs, Although, when TT says 1 FREE State Return they only mean filling out form, you still have to pay 24.99 for filing, which is bogus. Figuring out proper categories for business expenses is sometimes a challenge, even though they have helpful hints, and finding your way back to detailed Business Expense list can be frustrating due to vague category headings.



Also, when trying to contact TT consultants I had success 1 out of 4 tries. Sent an email and got a response in 30 minutes

but could not login in to send a second message. Called the 800 number twice, waiting approx. 50 minutes but was disconnected both times on TT end. Arrrrgh! Pathways back to Business expenses confusing. Tax Help lacking | 64009357|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|636
3 | Only the GOV gets exited about taxes! Just like the feds and the state burn you, turbotax does the same just not to the level of the gov.

Also, I was suppose to get a $15 credit from my credit union that I never saw the deduction or a spot to put a code for my bill reduction......I suppose that is what I get for waiting to the last minute.....

3 | oh my I am upset over the lack of up-frontness of the cost. I paid a Pro to do both of my returns two years ago for $100. This year it was about $140. I think doing it online should be considerably cheaper, not more expensive, and yes, my filing is not more detailed or complicated, it is the same as that year.

Last year I used a different online service and it was much cheaper. If I can remember, I will use them again next year. However, I will say TurboTax's information in helping you decide what to choose in certain instances was quite helpful. Very expensive | 64009332|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|641
3 | Once again, extra charges This is the second year in a row the promised free state return turned into an extra charge. Very frustrating to say the least. Also, due to your traffic jam my taxes were turned in late. I couldn't process payment and had to complete all sorts of technical work then restart to complete my taxes - now late. I would have been done at least 5 minutes early otherwise. Each year when it says I get a sate return for free it doesn't happen! I pay extra!! | 64009330|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|642
3 | Good but don't like fees You have to pay a substantial fee just to "maximize" your return, which is basically itemizing your return. Another program I used before did this for free.

In the past, purchasing the software package included both federal and state filing. Now the package only includes federal filing. Sad when there are no longer any rebates and the price of the federal package has gone up so significantly.



I was less than thrilled that it took considerable time to figure out how to apply a refund to next years taxes. Why can this not be a part of the regular questionnaire at least when a refund is determined.

1 | Hidden charge in "Free Federal Tax Return", Fraud I was charged $29.99 ($31.97 with tax) for service that I didn't select while processing "Free Federal Tax Return". The $29.99 was never shown anywhere and never confirmed before making payment, it was charged while I was placing my payment information for tax return. This is extremely unprofessional and sneaky way of charging hidden fees by TurboTax. I talked to the customer care for refund but she refused to give any solution and hung up. To sum up, before Turbotax charges its customers, it needs to show clearly what are the charges/fees then proceed with payment confirmation; not the other way around. Turbotax is a FRAUD!

I will have to file an amended 2015 return since a lot of business expenses for a business which operated at a loss was not able to be filed.

3 | Good but needs work Turbo Tax worked well and I recommend it. It is the only software I use.



However I have a number of concerns:

1) Turbo Tax for Mac does not allow importing data from Quickbooks for Mac. It would make things easier. There is definitely a bias against Mac.



2) Turbo Tax does not take into account where one divorced parent is deducting the children but the children are on the other parent's health insurance. The worksheets keep showing the kids on my insurance.



3) Also, it does not take into account married but filing separately and the health insurance. Needs to take into account divorced parents | 64009162|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|664

1 | Scammed by Turbo Tax I really liked Turbo Tax, except this year it seemed they felt they really needed to scam their consumers into paying additional amounts of money. I thought there was supposed to be free file for most this year. Ha! While filing I was told I should use itemized deductions, but to do that had to upgrade to Deluxe. Turned out I needed to use standard deduction but of course could not downgrade. Also though it would be great to pay Turbo Tax from my return as it says at the beginning, at the end find out that service is available, for 34.99.

Then, after I had already paid the upgrade fee and entered all my bank information - it ran a second final check and amazingly found a mistake that completely changed the picture. Seriously? Talk about bait and switch! Shame on you. What the heck was the first "final" check for??? That was misrepresentation saying that you had checked for mistakes and everything looked good - "you're ready to file". BS. I want a refund of the upgrade fee.

1 | What a piece of junk! Where do I even begin? This is the worst experience I have ever had with tax software. The health care section didn't work AT ALL. I essentially had to file an inaccurate return which I will have to go back and file amended later when I get my ACA exemption number. Two years to prepare for this and someone posted this exact problem to the help center four months ago and it still isn't fixed. The program insisted on including a schedule C with my return even though I didn't need it. It took forever to figure out how to print file my state return. (I'm guessing Intuit REALLY want that $24.95 fee!) And when I tried to print it, it kept telling me there were errors in my return after it cleared me to file through e-file! Is this a glitch? Am I going to get audited? Or is this another trick to get you go pay the fee to e-file? Honestly for $45 the state e-file should be free. What a rip off. If I don't get a phone call from someone offering to fix this, I won't be using this software again. Ugh. Program contains MANY errors | 64009057|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|678
3 | Great tool, but tricky state tax filing process I wish they could be honest upfront and let you know that they will try to force you into buying their services when filing state taxes. I understand they are providing a free service to file federal, but honesty regarding the payment for state taxes would be nice. This would prevent the person from wasting time filling information for state taxes to later find out you need to pay to file state taxes. I don't appreciate this at all. Next year, I will look for an alternative solution to file State and Federal taxes. Tricky filing process for state taxes | 64009050|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|679
3 | Not so Sure! I've used Turbo Tax for many years, but the past few years by level of confidence has really decreased. I no longer feel that I am getting the best refund and I always worry that something is wrong. There have been several simple mistakes in the software the last couple of years. If I can spot them why can't your SQA group detect them? lack of confidence in calculations and if I am getting the best refund possible. | 64009049|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|680

3 | Ehhh. Brother said use turbo tax, but honestly its not so great. You say everywhere you can import last years taxes from other software or a PDF, but it never asks. After two hours trying to get it to ask and trying every menu I could find, nothing, So I had to enter every last bit of it again. Had I stayed with Tax act, I would have been half done in those two hours. 



Also, you never show the forms.So when you ask questions with odd references, (and i am a person who has done taxes for years) and I can't see what form and line its referring to, its useless. You guarantee no mistakes, but thats bogus. If I answer no to a question that you don't clarify or explain, then you just blame me. After all I said no, right? So.....



Lastly, you charge alot of money for all that. And my return isn't any higher through you guys that others. 



So again, not impressed. especially considering the $120 price compared to $35. 



Thats my input.

Just more BS to make you pay for BS that they don't want to give away when they advertise it to be FREE... Force or fool you in to requiring to pay for services when it is suppose to be free | 64008996|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|684
3 | Slipping from previous years I've used turbotax since 2002 and I think this is my last year. To start I had to pay to access my prior year return; which I needed because it was incomplete. Second, The explanations on any given page are much shorter than they used to be and don't point you to any particular reg or code section. In many cases hand calculations were needed when in years past they would've been auto calculations. Finally and most importantly I can't see whats happening with forms until Im ready to file. I did a whole lot of work that I had to change because it showed up on the form wrong. no access to forms, locks you out of prior year return files without paying extra, minimal explanations, some hand calc | 64008994|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|685

When I did find it, I couldn't find where to enter that information in.

I went to "search" but of course that only loads up information about it. It doesn't point me to "where" in my return I could enter the info.

3 | Increasingly Disapoointed I have used TurboTax for MANY years now and I am sad to say that this will most likely be the last. The price is just too high. I understand that in this country, everything gets higher but TurboTax has priced themselves out of the market. I admit, I haven't done extensive research on other options but the small amount of research I have done has turned up some cheaper options that I will be exploring next year.

3 | Got the Job done, but Glitchy upon final purchase I've been using TurboTax for a few years. It is usually a helpful software. The last two years I had issue finalizing my e-file payment and had to wait 2 hours on the phone to resolve the issue. When I finally got to the final page, I kept getting an error for a form I never filled out (that was unnecessary for me). I like the software, but intuit has some serious bugs to fix.

3 | 1st timer self employed havnt a clue if i got all the deductions i could and not knowing exactly what little extra deduction can be had and no suggestions of what to look for. the cost to use turbotax was more than half of what i paid last year so guess what ill be doing next year based on how much time i spent filling in the info. if i had only a couple w-2 and some interest earned with a family do i see it being worth the time. if your self employed youll pay for additional forms needed just like the pros charge which means youll make more money going to work for a couple hours and paying an accountant to fill in your info. youll have to cut your cost for me to use it again. ill look at the other software and compare next year. would like more detailed explanations based on my specific situation. nickled and dimed. cut to the cost.

3 | Convenient but pricey. I think the interface was friendly and it was simple enough that I could have breezed through the whole process, had I not spent so much time trying to figure out if I was paying for the right "type" of turbo tax or not. As a part time student and cooperative worker my income isn't great so it's expected that I was a little shocked to see about a fifth of my refund go straight to y'all at turbotax. I think when I filed last year it was free or at least federal was free and I went to another site to file my state. Either way It was a huge disappointment to get charged 130 dollars american just so i could pay my taxes. But i was desperate and I'll still get money back so I guess I shouldn't complain.

3 | Tax Prep review I liked the one-click resources, the emailed / chat questions-answers, and the continual encouraging text at every step.

If you want to add value that people will pay for try lowering the price and including state and federal for 40 dollars for both.. this was pretty much the price point i recall paying in the past and it was well worth it.. 100 + after taxes is just too much. btw, i've used turbo tax for 10 years.. ouch.. asking for upgrade 7-9 times | 64008823|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|715

1 | Bad for Active Duty Military out-of-state I am active duty military. I did not need to file a state return because I am working away from my state of residence and my state of residence has no state income tax. After I filled out the tax return information for the state I am stationed at (I didn't need to do this), I could not delete or undo that entry. I did not need to file MD state taxes and the refund/payment on it was $0. I spent the last hour trying to get that null state entry off my return, but I could not, and gave up when I ran out of time and had to swallow the $50 for it even though I did not want to file the state return. Extra profit for TurboTax, but not good business practice. I had to pay $50 to file a state return even though I didnt need/want it | 64008785|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|721
3 | Good Service The product itself is decent, and it is convenient to file on your own time. The information provided throughout is very helpful and helped me understand most of my tax situation. 

On the other hand, I had to pay just as much to complete it myself as I did when I went to a tax preparation service (H&R Block/Jackson Hewitt, ETC.). The system said I could not use the free edition, but did not provide a detailed reason why. I have always completed a 1040 EZ, but this year it said I had to complete a regular 1040, but I do not have any deductions and have not changed the way I file over the past several years.

2 | Quality goes down every year I have been using Turbo Tax for years But I have noticed that each year the usability goes down. The worst this year is the "Smart Check." It is about the dumbest check ever. It identifies errors in a vacuum with no explanation as to how to correct them. Example: the "Principal Business Code." It states it needs to be entered, but there is no hyperlink to the codes to fill it in. Instead, you're supposed to go back to the form and run a search. But see if you can ever find a search button. 

After all these years of using Turbo Tax, I'm switching to a competitor's product for 2016. Less user friendly every year | 64008718|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|727

3 | Not thrilled, had better experiences in the past. I usually don't mind doing my taxes and enjoy using turbo tax because I feel confident in my tax return either because I had the previous knowledge or turbo tax provided a clear explanation. This year, I felt like it was much more confusing and there was far fewer descriptions; that is, there were less readily available as they had beed. I have been using turbo tax for maybe 10 years and felt I have learned so much about the process and always felt confident in my returns. In the previous versions over the years, options were included to easily and readily expand upon nearly every term, statement, or question in order to clarify any terminology or request for information, this year I felt like the "learn more" option left much to be desired as far as explanation or clarification. Further, once the search tool was open, there was no way to continue functioning within the tax form simulatanously. Previously, the browser allowed for both the ongoing tax return and search/help window to concurrently, therefore both could be open at all times. Currently, the browser only allowed one window to be open at a time, the tax return turned grey and to return to working the search window had to be closed. In addition, I should add that my rating should be even lower because my last return was a disaster when I requested part be put in a amazon card and never received the card. The issue with not receiving a card was a fixable issue, but it was the disastrous experiences with customer service that really earned turbo tax a much worse rating. Although up until recently, I always had good experiences but I never needed extra assistance and the complete disaster that was "assistance" makes me incredibly wary to continue doing my taxes with turbo tax or recommend the product to anyone else, in the case I ever needed actual help with a tax return. I'd have to urge Turbo Tax to do some revamping. Unclear, less explanations, awkward wording | 64008702|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|729

2 | 2015 Tax Filing through Turbo Tax I found the Turbo Tax software for tax year 2015 much harder to follow and more complex. My tax situation changed this year but I do not understand why. Historically my state refund correlated to my federal refund. This year I got my typical Federal tax refund but had taxes due to the State. I do not understand why. The "counter" moved the Federal owed/refund but the state "counter" did not change for some entries. I would not recommend Turbo Tax if you have had a significant change in events that affect taxes. However I would recommend for more simple tax situations that do not change year over year. Also did not explain the more complex and new issues as well as in the past, i.e. HTC, AMT. For the first time I had to call customer service to try to explain why the State "counter" was not moving when the Fed "counter" moved. I did not get a good explanation. If I had more time I would likely have called more often for other issues but was running out of tax deadline time. Also it was hard to look up and locate various items, such as my AGI. Overall I was not as happy with this year's Turbo Tax software. Not easy to understand differences from prior year | 64008685|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|731
2 | Taxes isn't fun but this site makes it worrysome Going back and forth with turbo tax is okay, as long as I get different result from what I originally expected from information I already inputted.

1 | State Refund rejected two consectutive years My state refund was rejected for Tax Years 2014 and 2015. 

In 2014, after multiple state rejections, TurboTax finally determined they were using the incorrect revision of the tax form. The rejections, investigation, and waiting for TurboTax to correct the form delayed my filing 2-3 months.

In 2015, after the first rejection I determined the problem- a required text field was left blank when TurboTax completed the form. I called customer service and after 30 minutes of discussion, they stated the only possible way to fix the problem was to remote into my computer. I declined and eventually TurboTax corrected their software. This cause me a 2 month delay in filing. State Refund was rejected two consecutive years | 64008663|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|735

1 | Too much time spent on a simple return Where do I start...I called early this morning when a very nice woman advised me that I didn't need to complete a form that the program continued to tell me I did. She advised I would need to delete my return and start over from scratch. Needless to say, I had to start over 3 times at the suggestion of the "Tax Experts". Finally on my last call the woman said she thought I could bypass the required form. In addition, she was having issues with the impersonation system so she wasn't able to view my screens that stated I was required to upgrade to the deluxe version for an additional $54.95. All for one simple form. This is the part that makes no sense whatsoever. Supposedly my return was too complex and not a simple return anymore due to me contributing to a company sponsored HSA account. I asked for her to waive the fee or a discount and she said that her supervisors wouldn't allow her to waive the fees. The representative agreed with my reasons for being frustrated but said she wouldn't lose her job for waiving the cost of the program. A company that doesn't empower their employees to help their loyal customers. Now I remember why I went with a competitors product last year. I will not be using TurboTax in the coming years based on my poor experience and wasted time. Everyone was nice but nobody could provide an ample resolution.

2 | Difficult - Home Office Feature, Not Intuitive Home Office Deduction - cost me 7 hours of time to remedy. Boo!



PROBLEM:

Program allows multiple forms to be created. 



Experience:

'Got all the way to file before the problem revealed itself, after of course I paid. Turns out - repetitive forms are not explained, not viewable. 



PROBLEM: 

Sch C Worksheet, form 8829, Form 2106 - do not match.

Tell me why. 



Program should suggest, or not even allow multiple forms to be created if "Only one office" is selected from the q&a. Goofy to allow otherwise.



Was totally unaware that I'd created multiple schedules 



PROBLEM STARTED BECAUSE:

The problem started because TurboTax read my POBOX as a home office, in addition to my physical address. Goofy!

 

PROBLEM:

You cannot view which form you must delete, prior to deleting.



TurboTax response: Here is how to delete...

Customer response: Got annoyed, started deleting forms blindly. Nice. 



If TurboTax does not respond to me and let me know that the problem is fixed, offer me some kind of a discount for the enormous amount of time this cost me, no, i will not use the program again. I think there are others out there that would be worth trying. not interested in paying $150.00 plus all the extra frustration, time. Used to love TurboTax.

1 | Dissatisfied Normally, I think TurboTax is helpful, however, this year, I found that at the end of my tax-doing session, extra fees had inexplicably been tacked onto my costs. I started with the Free version, and ended owing TurboTax approximately $150. All in all, I feel I lost money by filing my return this year. Next year, I might try H&R Block.

1 | Not Typical The program offered a free option which I use every year and love. After moving to a new state last year the great state of Colorado charged state taxes and now turbotax won't allow me to file for free.... at ALL. $180 later... so glad I chose a "Free" service. wouldn't allow me to file free before the deadline | 64008581|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|747
1 | Don't do it Turbo Tax needs to communicate more regarding their pricing. I had a simple Ez form which was supposed to be free for federal and 29.99 to file state electronically. When it was all said and done I paid almost 100 bucks for a simple return with no itemizations. Additionally when I filed for an extension without reservation or warning, I then needed to upgrade to the deluxe addition. Bogus!!!!! I am so ANgRY about this" Got roped into paying for more software or I had to delete my return and start again | 64008578|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|748
3 | THE OLD GRAY MARE: SHe Ain't What She Used to Be Not as good as she used to be. While Turbo Tax gives a lot of good information in pop-up boxes, you can't search around in it or see your returns in work the way you used to be able to do them. My guess is a lot of people are now balking at the outrageous cost of using Turbo Tax (even if they get a partnership discount) and have tried to use the service to figure stuff out, then gone and done the forms the long-hand way, basically robbing Turbo Tax of its profit for providing a service to them. But, it's aggravating to use, much more than it used to be. Harder to figure out how to correct something (or what exactly it is that is being corrected or why it needs correcting and when you get those, the pop-up explanatory boxes are not there anymore, so you can't learn what it is all about). Just no longer all that happy with TT, but I think it still beats the competition for having a product that actually works and can file your returns at the last minute if necessary. Can't see the returns anymore til you finish; more "BLACK BOX"-ish | 64008559|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|749
2 | Expensive I have used turbo tax online for several years as it was cheaper to process our taxes myself however over the last few years it would have been easier and cheaper for me to take them to the local accountant or tax service / preparer vs. paying what I paid to do them myself with your software. Expensive | 64008556|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|750
3 | Misrepresented I have used turbotax before but the only way I could file state was if I paid for it.. I am upset with this program because it is misrepresented. I couldn't e-file my federal because I didn't earn enough and I couldn't file with state because I was to broke to buy the software.

2 | GREAT Product Until the END-GREENDOT Killed DEAL Don't do it. You feel like you are in a SCAM with your TAXES; which is nerve - wracking enough for anyone. 

The software is very user-friendly, why I chose it. However, there is no indication of the multiple of fees they pile on you at the end, of course when you are the most anxious; and you have no choice. it says you do, but there is no access within the Disclaimer to get you where you want to go, only to the "Payment/Continue" Tab. pretty shady. the hidden fees you don't know about until you think you are done....you are NOT. You feel like you are in a scam. | 64008533|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|753

No longer use easy step for the 1040, but it used to work pretty well. It should allow free filing for the state and it is too expensive for what it does.

2 | Oversold I had a simple return. It should actually have been free and cost close to $100. There should have been an option for more detailed questions upfront to determine exactly what needed before I got hooked into one of the more expensive packages. Further, I was notified when all was said and done that it would cost another $40 to file the state taxes unless I backed them out and did it all separately. I also expected you to import all tax docs from fidelity or at least give the option. You go Intuit! It was smooth in more ways than one  | 64008487|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|758

Took me three times to finally delete it all and keep it out! This is the first time I've experienced this in 5 years of using TurboTax, so it seems they are getting a little sloppy with their work!

1 | So unhappy with Turbo Tax this year I have used Turbo Tax for years but this will be my last. We had a system issue with my computer. I called and the 1st representative was amazing. I called back and she could not help me. When I called back tonight...not only did I pay for the same state 3 times in the process of getting my taxes filed, but the man on the phone was rude. At the end, when his system died and he had to hope it rebooted correctly...he was a little kinder. Overall....worse tax experience. Poor customer service and over charged. | 64008440|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|766
2 | Annoyed by mobile app I've used turbo tax a few times before and I've always had a good interaction with it. I thought I'd save myself some time this year by using the mobile app to do my taxes since I had heard it was easy to do. The main reason I wanted to use the app was to upload my w-2 as I could do the rest on the computer if need be. At no point did it ever ask me to enter my w2 and the entire process I kept wondering when it was going to. I had seen ads about snapping a picture to make the process easier and I never could find the option for it. I got to a point in the app eventually that had squares where I could enter my w2 information but I wasn't able to click on anything, I couldn't move around hardly to see anything, it was impossible to zoom in or read, and there was no way to go forward back or get more information. I reset and reloaded the app a few times and got the same issue so I eventually just went to my computer to do the rest. Part of the information transferred over but there were major holes of things it said I hadn't reviewed. I eventually got everything cleared up but the disconnect between the app and the site was large enough I still completely regret using both mediums. I feel like I coulda missed something and with these being done last minute it really does make you regret using turbo tax this year. Also with all that being said, the website never did give me the opportunity to take a picture of my w2 or import it via another medium. Not a huge fan this year turbo tax... mobile app confused and annoyed | 64008433|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|767
3 | Filing made easy Great way to safely and easily file your taxes. Things are simplified so anyone can understand. Only con is that they seem to be nickeling and dining you for everything. If you are filing under the free return it would be nice to upload your previous information but instead it deletes all your information and makes you start from scratch. Nice service, but i will be using a different company next year that gives more benefits for the free returns. Reducing benefits for free filing | 64008432|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|768
1 | What the? Seriously, another $25? Why is state e-file not included with purchase?

Why is state e-file not included with purchase of additional states?



Because you are terrible. If there is any justice the taxpayer simplification bill will pass congress this year and your racket will be defunct. You will be charged an extra $25 several times. | 64008414|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|769
3 | Disappointed in state tax filing Much to my surprise, turbo tax tries to collect a $24.95 fee for filing a state tax form. In the past, 1 state form was included in the cost of Premier. Premier charges for filing 1 state form | 64008405|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|770
1 | Not Amused I chose the free edition of TurboTax, as many of my friends and family did this tax season and was more than displeased when the page came up to pay and asked me for $29.99.

1 | Turbo Tax Troubles This program is a complete rip off and I will not use it again. I am dissatisfied with the outcome which was that my Return was rejected due to Turbo tax telling me that my return was wrong because I was claiming my daughter and she was also claiming herself which was absolutely false. I couldn't efile because of a Turbo Tax problem and had to make a late night trip to the post office. | 64008284|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|789
3 | Prices for required packages getting too high. I would probably be considered low income. I have a traditional employer, but I also have a small income from freelance work. In order to report that income, I had to upgrade to the Home & Business package, for $104.99. That seems like an exorbitant fee increase, especially for something which used to be included in much lower cost packages. Next year I may have to consider other filing options, as the cost may not be worth the convenience. The expense of the more "complex" packages is too high. | 64008278|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|790

2 | Hmmm... I've used Turbo Tax for over a decade through various stages of my life (college student, marriage, job change and children). I have an accounting degree and would always advise people who asked me to help with their taxes to use Turbo Tax when doing fairly simple tax returns. However, now that I've filed my 2015 taxes, I realized that the Turbo Tax checks didn't see that I missed the sales tax deduction for 2014. I would have expected the final checks to highlight this omission. I fully recognize that this is something that I should have noticed myself. However, I am definitely less likely to recommend to my friends and will be filing with a professional going forward. Doesn't really check everything | 64008229|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|798
1 | This is the worse program I have always used turbo tax and starting last year it started getting bad. I purchased turbo tax deductions & homeowners and it did not work on my laptop because it had window 10 on it. It let me put information but it showed VOID when printed and it would not let me e-file. I paid 496.98 from Sam's Club and couldn't use it. I thought that was bad. This year I saw turbo tax free filing, only to put in my information using turbo tax deluxe and as I put in information the program changed to turbo premier and transferred last year's information but would not allow me to open and work in the program, causing wrong information on my return and then charged me $79.99 for the program.

You Can press the remove button and it will (seemingly) remove the premium fee, but when you get to the point where you're just about ready to press ."submit"' the fee reappears (I tried removing it a few times).

1 | Turbo Tax is terrible!!!!!!!!! Thanks for wasting my money and time. When i started Turbo Tax Free edition, there were 3 options your no-good web-site said i had, one of which was importing W-2's. Well that didnt happen, which is the ONLY reason i used your service at all. My mistake was procrastinating, because if I were not crunched for time, i would of deleted my account, left bad feedback and never ever used your site again. You also sneek a $35 dollar fee for using your federal return. 



I will go out of my way to show people how to use federal and state e-file services so they dont get screwed over by Intuit. Not Free | 64008040|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|817

1 | Difficult time navigating I got all ready to file my return when I got a message letting me know I had to fix the federal claim because I'd claimed more than 50% of my Wisconsin income in deductions. I was then given some figures which seemed to be in line with what I was seeing on my W2s. I could not figure out how to go back and check my federal or my state returns so, with 2 hours to go before the deadline, I finally whipped out my paper Wisconsin form 1A, went through it quickly, changed some numbers on turbo tax, crossed my fingers and hit "submit". I was SO disappointed in turbo tax this year. If my federal return wasn't right then why did the stupid software say "Yep, looks good. Let's move on to the state return now."?

1 | Forced to use turbo tax deluxe This year I'm forced to use the deluxe edition and I think it's because I entered the student loan 1098e interest paid in my tax return, but after I did a calculation I realized the total amount I get back is less if i just don't report the student loan interest paid and use the free edition, but by the time I find out it's already too late because there are no options for me to return to the free edition.



you rip 90 dollar off my refund and " hope you all choke on that money, fxxking aXXholes you betray the people who use your service.



never using your service again, like ever again, I don't mind paying a fee if it was honest, if you just be honest and charge a certain fee I still would have use your service, but no you had to be sneaky and pull bxxxh axx move to scam money, I'd rather pay for an paid-tax reporting service than using turbotax again because of the poor business ethic you have. you should all be ashamed of yourselves. you rip me off assholess | 64007945|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|827

3 | SO easy-- just ask their lobbyists why! I wish TurboTax would do right for all taxpayers and stop paying thousands upon thousands of dollars to their lobbyists to keep the tax code so complicated that people can't file on their own. It's absolutely criminal that TurboTax and HRBlock and the other major tax preparers all keep paying off our politicians so that they won't reform the tax code to make it simpler to file. We could all be doing our own taxes but Turbo Tax wants to keep earning your $100 every year so they make it virtually impossible for people to understand their own filing. it's easier than filing yourself because they paid congress! | 64007874|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|837

if you don't do anything to out of the ordinary, you'll be fine. Own your own business, need to provide more info, need to better understand where to do something... you are basically on your own.

I was supposed to buy the disc from the store if I wanted to do more than one return for my family. Although the cost was the same, I had no idea until it was too late and I ended up doubling the cost from Turbotax. You can only use the purchased online software for one person but store product can be used for many more and costs same | 64007820|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|845
1 | frustrated for the first time I have used Turbo Tax for at least a decade if not two. never had a problem. tonight I was trying to submit my son's return and it would just sit there. I spent 3 hours over and over. ended up going on line to repurchase the state then had to do a manual download for the federal for updates that are probably nothing to do with me and it would not allow me to submit the returns without doing all this and paying twice for the state.

1 | Don't Get the Deluxe When I started out it ask me questions about myself. Income marital status ect.. then it recommended the deluxe version to "maximize my refund" being that i was concerned that i already pay 35% income tax i was really hoping this was true. Well.... Didn't save me a penny more but did cost me an extra 60 buck for something that was free. Needless to say i will be taking my business elsewhere. Its one thing to be reamed by the government for 20% more taxes than billionaires or even the President but this really twisted the knife.

She basically told me I could start over or run a diagnostic. I had a specific question about a specific line item and she could not help me. She put me on hold to wait another hour for someone who could help. I just gave up and tried to figure it out on my own.

3 | Some Improvements Suggested Been filing with TurboTax for at least two decades now. I have some suggestions: 

1. To keep competitive with similar online tax filing systems, offer state tax filing to $39.99 for up to TWO states. 

2. In 1099-R form, offer an option that exempts taxes in the situation where the money rolled over is AFTER-TAX 401K monies that employee can distribute without being taxed. It is similar to ROTH exception, but it is not a Roth. Speak to IRS to make this an option as it is quite common that employee will continue to give to 401K AFTER-TAX if they have met the IRS max limit regulation. There is no tax to distribute this money since it was already taxed.  | 64007753|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|856

1 | Double charged me I entered my payment info... it said 'something went wrong - we couldn't charge that card'... they did charge it. And I had to make the payment a second time. Now, after spending hours on this bs, I have to deal with getting a refund for the additional charge. I tried calling, but didn't have the battery or the will power for a 45 minute wait time.



Also, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell how much it will cost (except them saying "it's free"... until you've spent hours filling out forms. Then you find out it costs over $100. Double charged my credit card | 64007743|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|858

3 | State continues to lag Federal I find that Turbo Tax continues to improve the Federal return filing process and corresponding worksheets (e.g., for keeping track of nondeductible traditional IRA contributions). However, there is a significant deterioration in the experience with State returns - particularly in the process of allocating income sources. In the absence of including allocations in the "interview" TT should at least provide access to the worksheets (this year they locked them down). State return adjustments not built in to the interview process | 64007724|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|861
3 | Disappointed: Erased 1099 Data I am a long term user of Turbotax and will keep using it. However, on Thursday when we finished the data input it showed taxes due of $2,600 using the laptop. When I opened it with my pc on Monday night to make submission it showed refund of $5,317. I was incredibly happy and went so far as to pay and print out the return before taking a closer look. My income was 30K too low because my wife's independent contractor 1099 income was dropped out. All the other information of the 1099 was there except for the earnings. Had I not caught it at the very last minute, it would have been a mess. I called customer support but after waiting for 54 minutes the line dropped. Anyhow, no one should expect service on the filing night. I am surprised this happened. I can't think of anything I did to have caused it. If they investigate and show that it was my mistake I would take it back. Erased my 1099 data | 64007697|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|862
2 | Costs keep going up! State cost is ridiculous compared to the federal return. You guys have to be kidding when you expect $34 to have Turbo Tax take the fees for the software out of the tax refund. Someone isn't paying attention when they chose that option. Generally disappointed that fees increase each year and that is when I look for some sort of discount to reduce it. One of these years I will choose another vendor. Stop raising the fee in the weeks leading up to April 15th tax filing deadline - if you think you need an increase do it Jan 1st - not when people are heading into tax filing and now feel pressured. Costs keeps going up. | 64007685|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|863
3 | Honestly, improve the flow from screen to screen I had to figure out when to go back and start over on various sections because of confusing sections of the workflow. You REALLY need a UX designer or information architect to come in and fix this up for next year - a serious backwards slide from 2014. 



For instance - income, imported a return with two W-2's. and they both show up. Click the first to fill it in, at the end of that W-2, it says "Do you have another W-2 to enter?" Well yes, I do. But if I click yes, it prompts me to fill in all the employer info. So, go back, say "No", and select the other one that is already in the system and fill it out. ???



Another instance - Try to e-file, but one state's criteria doesn't allow it. Instead of actually helping me, it tells me to go to the next screen and select "print and file". I do that (which gives me a nice red warning that it's a 'bad idea'), and then dumps me back into the beginning of the workflow so I can click through all the federal screens again! !!!



Really, you can do better than this with the resources you have. The User Experience needs serious work | 64007684|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|864
2 | Was better last year Last year I don't remember constantly being requested to "upgrade" for extra features every few screens. I also qualified for free state filing but no matter what I tried they wanted my $30 bucks to file it. I finally just gave in since I couldn't figure out a way to get around it. Never had that problem last year and I still qualify for free state and federal filing.



They also want to sign you up for "bonus" offers. You need to pay attention and read all the screens because they want your info to sell to others.



Conveniently when I tried to set my contact settings for them to not spam me with their marketing, it said it could not be completed at this time. I am sure they will sell my information now. Any way to make a few extra bucks I guess.



I will try them again next year but if they keep putting up the nag screens I think I will look for a different filer. Constant "upgrade" offers, charged for what should be free state filing | 64007672|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|865

I also am disappointed that after HAVING to file home and business knowing I would be taking the non itemized deduction because I wouldn't have enough to make it worth itemizing, I am still charged over 100 dollars,,,,triple of what I should pay. I also had a $20 off offer from brads deals which was impossible to use. tax act for me next year.

2 | Very Disappointed Still does an excellent job walking you through even the most complicated taxes. HOWEVER this year for the first time it froze every 5 minutes at a minimum. Working fine, and then all of a sudden the mouse and touchpad would move the cursor, but you could not select anything, or key from the keyboard etc. Frequently more frequent than that. Had to save on every screen, then when it happened use 'end task' to do an abnormal end to the return, and then launch it again, and re-enter the data that you had not saved yet.



So frustrating. I have used Turbo Tax for decades, but I may be forced to try another vendor after this frustrating experience. For the first time ever it kept freezing and keyboard and mouse would not work - only in Turbo Tax | 64007625|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|870
1 | Not using turbo anymore I've always found turbotax quick and easy and worth the nominal additional cost vs other tax prep services. It's

2 | Not good compared to past years experience Several times in the preparation of this years return, I had thoughts about jumping ship and working with another product. Since I didn't use the "installed" product for TurboTax this year, it is difficult for me to know whether the inability to see form previews is only a limitation in the online version. I would recommend anyone requiring "Home & Business" to avoid the online version and use a product where forms are visible. There were several times where hyperlinks could have been implemented, but there was only text that said "be sure to visit the education section" for instance. Inability to see previews of actual tax forms and have links back to the entry is a real drawback. | 64007619|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|872

2 | Functional but pricey I'm pretty tax clueless but was able to navigate TurboTax with ease. Not happy that $124 was taken out of my refund (which was 600) for TurboTax fees.

2 | Buggy Product Encountered a serious issue with .TXF import. It won't take the Brokerage name while entering or editing. Just displays "No Financial Institution" as the name. Thought I could tolerate that, but when I imported the .TXF file for another Brokerage, TurboTax overwrote the information entered earlier since it thought all "No Financial Institution" has to be the same. I had to manually merge the TXF files and make it one before entering again. Shame on TT! If I need to edit anything later, makes me repeat the whole process!

1 | Swindled I was gathering my tax information at 10:30pm on tax night, and knew that buying a house and getting that big promotion would mean a full hour and a half should be set aside. Turbo Tax then explained that the Free version wasn't for me. OK, I thought, I have to itemize because of the house, but NO! This was not needed and the simple free return I have come to know and love was taken from me. I could have (after searching every google page known to man in 10 minutes, but nothing on the website intuitively(double paren for word-play)) simply started over, had there been a reasonable assumption that I could do my taxes in another 20 minutes and not fall asleep or have the internet go out on me. I was then flabbergasted to see that withdrawing from my taxes cost another $35, if only I had the time to find my wallet, woe is me.

2 | bad start, good finish I purchased the product (Home & Business) at a big box store; a few weeks ago I entered basic personal information, but today (tax day), on startup it asked if I wanted to check for updates. Of course I did - but the program couldn't extract the new information. Worse yet, the only option it gave me was to wait and try updating later (I couldn't go to forms, etc.). In other words, it was frozen. I called customer support, spoke to a helpful fellow named Jonathan and all turned out well. But it seems this is a known defect with Mac computers as they try to work with the CD from the box stores - so why sell them there in the first place?

1 | Comprehensive, but Expensive TurboTax has gone downhill. When I first started using it, I was able to consolidate 1099-MISC income from contracting into the free Federal return. State was always additional, but it was a good deal: $40 to file your taxes.



Now, TurboTax doesn't clearly explain what its features are until you try to access something in an expanded package. Then it hits you up for more cash. I ended up paying $100 for something that used to cost me $40. All for no increase in functionality.



At this point, I'd likely recommend someone go to an in-person tax prep specialist - someone who you can build a relationship and who can actually advise you on how to maximize your tax picture. TurboTax does none of this. It might be cheaper than a live prep agent, but not much any more. The savings aren't worth it for the meager functionality you get. Extremely expensive and core functionalities increasingly stripped away | 64007479|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|893
3 | Pretty straight forward but... I'd really like for TT to, at the beginning, simply ask for a list of the forms I have and be able to deduce the most efficient method of entering the data. There are a lot of questions asked that TT should already know the answer to.

Also, TT tries too hard to be sneaky when asking to add fees for additional 'product'. Even worse is the sly way of going thru Green Dot. It's fairly obvious that those who need to use their refund to pay for TT probably really need as much of their refund as they can get. $34.99 for this service is ridiculously greedy on the part of Green Dot. asks questions it should already know the answer to | 64007475|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|894
2 | Intuit LOBBIES for more complicated filing? I've been receiving emails that tell me Intuit continues to lobby for a complicated tax code in order to protect revenues from tax filing software. I understand that this isn't a moral decision by Intuit....it is a business decision. But where do we draw the line? The IRS tax code is far too complicated and unwieldy for any one person to understand all the aspects therein. It takes hours to accurately tally and input data either onto IRS forms using worksheets, or through the TurboTax Online or purchased PC software products. Looking through and understanding instructions plus processing time, is time that is taken from GDP and personal lives. That is true for every employee of Intuit just as it is for every other federally taxed person inside and outside of the US. So Intuit is not only paid for the use of software, but also reducing GDP and personal time. Maybe we should lobby Congress to send Intuit an invoice for the burden Intuit puts upon the economy.

2 | Needs improvement I had a couple of state-specific issues that made filing my return very painful. Wife works in MA and from home in NH, and we both live in NH. The only way to apportion income is by using the tax forms; it cannot be done using "step by step". Customer service rep was awesome in explaining how to use the forms. But, it got a lot worse when I filed jointly for the federal return, and then tried to file separate for my wife in MA. TurboTax makes you create "mock" returns, and I had to do my taxes all over again for myself and my wife. It was such a nightmare that I gave up. I think that the software should automatically allow you to file a separate state return for one spouse. Filing jointly for federal, separate for state is a disaster | 64007376|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|901

1 | Not Happy I selected to use turbotax because it was free..... or so I thought. At the very end after I put in all the information it forced me to "upgrade" to the $54.99 plan. When my refund was only going to be 101.00 plus it took a $34.99 processing fee. I am very unhappy. If I could have filed taxes sooner #but I didn't file till the deadline because I was pre-occupied with my 4 month old son having 2 open heart operations in the past 3 weeks# and saw this I would have went another way rather than using turbotax. I am very unhappy turbotax is lucky that its the deadline to file taxes and was able to take advantage of me, if I had more time I would have filed somewhere else. I would like a response as to why it forced an "upgrade" When you select the free its not free | 64007319|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|905

3 | Easy and Convenient but Getting Pricey I've used Turbo Tax for years and I love how convenient it is having everything stored year after year. The software is easy to use and provides good explanations along the way. But in recent years the program has started forcing me to use a more advanced version and charging me more. I was especially frustrated this year when the regular website price I saw was lower than the affiliate "discount" price I received when I went through the affiliate websites. I couldn't remove the affiliate and then ended up having to pay the higher price. I will likely try a different service next year and see how it compares.

1 |  I had no interest in using the expensive deluxe package, but there was no opportunity to use Turbotax's basic, free service. I ended up pigeonholed into using the pay service, and owed money on my taxes.

To my surprise....the wait time was over 60 minutes and I was never helped.....so what did I pay for again? Not sure either. 



Also, after shelling out the cash for the Deluxe package at checkout it informed me that because I agreed to pay the $54.99 for Deluxe I also had to pay $39.99 to file my state taxes...oh AND I also had to pay $34.99 to file at all because I clicked on Deluxe to deduct from the refund. SOOOOOOO my question is, why weren't these fees told to me when I clicked that I would pay the $54.99? Not sure either.

I've used other online programs in the past and paid very little for their services and been completely satisfied with the e-filing process. This year as I moved and changed jobs, I paid $50 for each state just to download the forms and $25 for each state to file them. That's an extra $150 I had to pay due to moving and having to file two state returns. I find it very excessive.  | 64007164|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|923

2 | Great Idea Poorly Executed I used to prepare taxes at a CPA firm, so I feel I am pretty aware of what is needed with tax software. I have used Turbo Tax the last 5 years, and haven't had any major issues. With the 2015 version, I became very frustrated since the software froze literally every 5-6 minutes. Therefore, if you are really focused on the entries you are making and forget to save, it will only recover to the last section finished. This was very irritating when entering my business and rental expenses. Normally, I don't mind using Turbo Tax, but this past year was not impressive to me.

It wanted me to upgrade to PLUS, but I already had a the Business and Home account. Then after hours of navigating in circles, I figured out they wanted me to pay up front to access previous year returns. But in order to get to a payment screen I needed to begin my return for this year. Once I did that and paid for my account, I downloaded last years return, but when I went to import it into this year's return it wouldn't let me because I had already started my return.

2 | I'm very disappointed with your fees I am very disappointed with your fees and the means you use to disclose them. You charged me last year for the plus pacgake which I never chose to be apart of. I did get a refund for this but this year it automatically put me back into the plus package and charged me another $30. Which all the emails Uve sent me from the 1st of the year promised the federal vtax return for free. By the time you realize your getting charged for a product you don't want it's too late. I'm very disappointed in which you trick consumers into using this product. I can remember my personal info and don't need your product for this. Fees | 64007054|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|936
1 | Fees are outrageous This service is okay for what it provides. However, I'm not a fan of the pricing structure as you don't really know what you're paying for until after you've completed your return. Too expensive will not file Turbo Tax again next year. This year's taxes were $20 more than last years for the same preparation. Very expensive | 64007048|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|937

I went back to "federal" and "deductions" trying to delete the entry with no success. Please make it easier to review and delete deduction mistakes. This took a couple hours to accomplish. *bonks forehead* The search function saved the day and pointed me to the way to delete the mistake (though it took some trial and error).

3 | Turbo Tax 2015 I will research some of the free software available during the 2016 tax season due to the following:

 -Cost of software, $69.99

 -State Filing Fee, $24.99

 -State Refund, $2.00



Needless to say, I could have saved money by telling the state to keep the $2.00. Didn't see a way to avoid this situation with the online filing. Cost of software $69.99, cost of filing state return 24.99 for a 2.00 refund. | 64006852|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|953

2 | Review of Turbo Tax for trusts I'm fairly new to doing trust taxes and using form 1041. Your "easy step" for the 1041 is basically useless. It assumes you already know exactly what you are doing. If I knew what I was doing I would not need easy step. The easy step for the 1040 is better. Easy step is not helpful at all, other tax guidance not much better. | 64006804|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|957
1 | Blood suckers $60 for a very easy filing procedure. I must be very, very lazy. Program sort of tricks you into paying more. Free federal actually means $29 to import last year's data and $29 to do state taxes and if you want to deduct fees from the refund they CHARGE YOU ANOTHER $34. It took me forever to figure out how to change that and pay the fee with my credit card. If it wasn't 8:00pm on the last day to file, I'd go print it and find a post office. I keep forgetting this is a bit of a racket. 



I may have a different opinion if I had a more complicated return but for the simple stuff I am an idiot for paying $60 just to save an hour of my time plus a trip to the post office. Expensive, difficult to change | 64006801|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|958

1 | State tax filing wrongly listed as free Both the federal and my state's websites say my state e-filing through TurboTax should be free based on my status and income level. However, at the end of the TurboTax process it wanted to charge me $29.99 for state. I waited over an hour to speak to someone at TurboTax. She said the free offer expired two weeks prior to the tax deadline and she will email me a special code to over ride the fee since I pointed out that an expiration is not disclosed anywhere in writing. Turns out the code didn't work either so I'll do state taxes the old fashioned mail-in paper way. Very disappointed.  | 64006792|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|960

After contacting support online, I was supposed to get a call back in 95 minutes. Several hours later I still had not received the call and checked my email. Six hours after my initial contact, I had gotten an email telling me that there was a problem with the phone system. I followed the instructions to call back in and the recording stated that there was a 15 minute wait. 55 minutes later I am still waiting for a human being to answer and have e-filed in the meantime due to the deadline.

1 | Disappointed After completing my draft taxes as married filling jointly, I felt that I needed to verify whether filling separately is the better way to go. This is extremely challenging using turbo tax to the point it's likely more easy doing the taxes by hand. I am thoroughly disappointed in the user interface for this option and I will not be using TurboTax in the future. After going through the arduous process I discovered it did indeed save us more money to file separately (even though TurboTax supposedly guarantees the best savings). Without an overhaul to the option for this filing I will not be using TurboTax again. Very challenging for married filing separately | 64006744|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|965

I chose Turbo Tax because i'm a young newlywed with 2 vehicles as our only assets. I did not expect it to be mor thatn the advertised 29.99, it was just so frustrating that after all the time i spent on the taxes i had to go back and try to find where they added on these charges so that i could eliminate them. all the little add on's they try to get you to purchase | 64006727|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|968
1 | Rip off Charges a ton of money so you can print out your own tax forms and send them in yourself. what a waste of effort and money.

Won't send in both state and federal forms without charging you extra, good luck if you have to file in multiple states. Also, won't send in state taxes at the same time as Federal taxes when they charge you to do it yourself.

More effort than it is worth and cost me more money. Had to mail in by own return myself and paid Turbotax a ton of money for that privilege. | 64006726|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|969

I could not find where to deduct my $18,000 of health insurance premiums. for this reason I already know i'll need to file an amended return.

3 | good and bad i like the program, but since I am somewhat familiar with taxes I found the walk through a bit slow.



Also, I would prefer to be able to see the actual tax return once a section is completed. For example, when all income has been entered I would like to see the income section of the actual 1040.

1 | What Happened?! I have LOVED TurboTax for years - so I was appalled and very disappointed at how greedy and difficult this year's new format was. At multiple steps throughout the process, it forced me to purchase higher costing tax filing products, giving me no option but to pay up unless I was willing to start from scratch with all of my information deleted. To add insult to injury, as I was submitting my final taxes - after everything had finished being reviewed and was approved - it did it one last time, forcing me to either upgrade to Deluxe or delete everything that had already been completed. That's slimy behavior and not one I am interested in experiencing again next year. I am extremely disappointed to see a great company succumb to bad business practices and greed. 



Bottom line: I have recommended TurboTax for years to all my friends, but after this experience I'm telling them to go elsewhere. So disappointing! Extortionist | 64006448|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1003
1 | Payed for Turbo Tax for no good reason. I filed and was rejected and then I went to re file and it said I then had to pay $29.99. Called to try and figure it out and the guy said there was nothing I or he could do. That the only thing I could do is file and pay the $29.99. So I did. And because of that I will not be using turbo tax anymore. Thats just not good service to someone who has used your product for the past 5 years. And I will no longer be telling people to use turbo tax. Its a shame because I used to really like your product. Had to pay and the guy said he could not help me. | 64006430|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1004
3 | Not pleased this year This year I recommended Turbotax to a friend. He is a real estate agent . I relied on TT to pick the correct format for him and it printed two different filings, one nearly ( but not completely) blank(????) and I was very confused and frustrated at which to file. Being as he owed nothing... we filed the complete version, and then .... TT charged him for a more expensive version, so he paid more than he probably had to to efile a return that he owed no money on...still scratching my head....... worst part is he is hoping we chose correctly. Several of the answers on the forms were not posed directly as a question....does TT extrapolate the answers from the questions they DID ask??? If he owed money...I would be very scared right now. This is why I will probably go with someone else next year and for sure will not recommend this product. It used to seem so easy and TRUSTWORTHY ( I have used TT for the past 8 or so years).

3 | Nice sneak Was loving everything, until the $34 bank fee for processing a direct deposit request. Really felt like I was being messed with and like you were trying to sneak one by me. Not cool. Bank processing fee for direct deposit | 64006418|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1006

3 | Could be better The program is easy to use and explains things well, but there shouldn't be a separate fee to file state taxes. Make it all, one upfront cost. Otherwise it feels like robbery on top of the taxes. Way overpriced | 64006403|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1008
3 | Disappointed loyal customer I have been a loyal TurboTax customer for nearly 30 years, basically from the PS2 3-1/2 floppy disk days. And I have been quite satisfied in general by the program; tried others but always came back. But until this year I never felt that I was being ripped off by TurboTax. I made the mistake of buying a Deluxe CD, not realizing that it did not include the 1 free state tax prep as had been the case with all the other previous TurboTax programs I have ever used. Instead it seems that there are two different deluxe versions, one with the free state and one without. So I was blindsided by the $45 charge to download a state program on top of the federal program I had previously bought. $45!!! That nearly doubled the cost of the program for me, whereas if I had been smart I could have bought the combination CD for far less than the total I paid. That to me is just greed on Intuit's part, catching the incautious customer in a bind and then making them to pay a ridiculous premium price. This on top of last year's messing with the files and taking forms out of the Deluxe federal tax program that had always been there. So what's up Intuit? Have the bean-counters taken over to the point that you have to gouge us customers with whatever means necessary?? You have come very close to losing a loyal customer with all of these shenanigans. Please cut us a break and offer more moderate and FAIR prices for the state download! Ridiculously high charge for doing a state return | 64006395|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1009

1 | Disappointed at added charge I was very happy with my service with Turbotax in the past and have been using this service for many years. This year while filing I was offered the Max Defense multiple times which I declined. After working on my refund many times I finally logged back in to pay for my refund and only saw the charges for my federal and state. I entered my account info and paid then when I read my receipt I realized that I paid an additional $50 for a service that I had declined many times. If I somehow approved it that was totally by accident and when you search for help on how to get it removed the answer is that you can't. This is very disappointing to me since I have been a loyal customer for so long and am not happy that I paid $50 for a service that I never wanted. I love the ease of use but will not be using this service again if I have to worry about the potential of accidentally being charged for something I had previously declined and then not having the option to have it refunded.

2 | Expensive and didn't have the advice that I needed $104 is far too much to pay for a do-it-yourself solution. I needed the most expensive version because I had stock purchased in an employee stock purchase plan and the company was acquired by another in a stock and cash transaction. Turbo Tax did not have the advice that I needed - I had to find instructions for adjusting my basis by hand. At that price, I could have gotten a professional to do my taxes for me. This is probably my last year filing with Turbo Tax. Not a good value | 64006366|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1016

3 | Unfairly expensive, but convenient. After finding out that I owe the IRS nearly 700 dollars, the last thing i wanted to see was that I needed to spend $145 dollars to file the taxes in the first place.



Just because I'm self employed, I have to pay an extra 105 dollars to file, and because I was getting no federal return there was no option to take from that to pay for it. Expensive, preys on people who don't know how to file | 64006363|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1018
3 | Software and service Software was easy to use, but my tax situation was a bit more complicated. I contract with an outside company who handles my payroll, work comp, etc. My employees aren't leased; they're shared, so I don't have an EIN number. What category do I put this under???? If I enter them as am employee, then I need to provide my EIN. If I put them as contract labor, I need to send them a 10-99. If I put them under miscellaneous expenses, does that increase my risk of audit??? Those were my concerns on the Federal side. On the State side, I employ a veteran, but the payroll is managed by the third party. Do I still get the State tax credit??? 



I'm not sure that this product was the best fit for my business needs. What made matters worse was that when I needed assistance figuring these things out, I couldn't find a phone number anywhere! Without any other recourse, I put in a "ticket" for customer service via TurboTax Home & Business. I received an order number and a message stating that someone would contact me with-in 45 minutes. Well...4 hours later and still no phone call! NOT GOOD! Especially on April 18th!!!



In their defense, there was one other time in March that I requested support for a assistance and this was provided in a timely fashion. 



lastly, when my tax return was declined due to a faulty entry of a Social Security number (my bad), I was appreciative to receive an e-mail, but disappointed at the lack of guidance. Of course, the e-mail boasted assistance at no additional cost, but even then, no phone number was provided. I walked myself through the editing process, which was not nearly as intuitive as one might hope. 



I got the rejection e-mail at 9 pm on 04/18. I mean, is there still time to file by mail?? If so, do I include a check, or will the electronic payment I requested still go through??? And what if it doesn't go through? Do I get penalized? Help!!! How do I fix this issue??? The answer: figure it yourself because TurboTax isn't going to help you!!!!



At the end of the day, I made it through...At least, I think I did. I think. I am still waiting on the second attempt at processing the return, so I guess the result is still unknown.



Overall, the software was great for uncomplicated situations, no so good for more robust scenarios. Also, don't' hold your breath for help that may never come. File early, or don't use the program. That's my advice. Customer support | 64006356|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1019

3 | I hate taxes I always feel like a complete and utter moron when filing taxes. Last year with TT I felt pretty smart, but this year I returned to idiocy. Last year, TT told me what I could deduct and they encouraged me to list things. This year they didn't, but they did compare my deductions this year to last, with a difference of $250! What changed?! Why didn't TT help me figure it out. I feel bummed that I'm paying so much more this year, when my deductions should be the same. That's not really TT's fault, but I'm bummed regardless. For some reason I didn't have as many deductions, and TT didn't tell me how to change that. | 64006352|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1021
1 | More Expensive Every Year! Over the past two years, I have had to use a more complex tax return due to contracting work. I am very unhappy with the site's treatment of this. They are maximizing their profits even though they are still only filing one form. Also, there is little warning that there will be an extra 34.99 charged when you pay the amount through your tax return. I had to go back through and change it to pay now. I will be filing my taxes With another site next year. I won't be wasting my money on this website. You have lost a customer!

2 | Only useful for simple returns I have an unusual type of income and TurboTax made it almost impossible for me to enter it correctly. It also misled me as to how to file patent income, which has cost me hundreds of dollars over the past few years. If you have a simple return, just do it yourself. If you have something complicated, pay someone and avoid the headache. Almost impossible to use for unusual tax situations | 64006272|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1026
1 | There is no such thing as free Just start with the deluxe. They will make you pay any ways and it will be a huge waste of your time.

1 | Don't Trust It You would think that spending $125 would get you a program that actually functioned. Not only are the instructions so bad that you have to go off the Turbo Tax site to get help, but even if you figure it out and follow the instructions all the way through- up to and including being told that your return has been submitted successfully - don't believe it.



An hour or so after you file the return (and have taken any envelopes to the post office and mailed them) you'll get an email from Turbo Tax saying that your return has been rejected.



In my case it was a pin number problem and the website that TurboTax sent me to was "unavailable". When I returned to my file, and went through all the steps that the Turbo Tax "help" center (what a laughable term) said to go through, it just double filed my federal return. Waiting now for the second rejection. Thanks for nothing Turbo Tax. Not accurate | 64006260|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1028
2 | Much Improved - Not Worth the Cost This product has GREATLY improved over the previous editions of the "Deluxe" product. A much better process flow has been implemented that asks simple questions which better explain themselves when trying to evaluate what data to enter. The "more info" sections were also effectively helpful. I was never stressed or scream in frustration.



However, at a cost of nearly $150.00 to process a standard deduction return without any bells and whistles. I find myself reaching for the telephone to make an appointment with H&R Block next year. These costs were also assessed in an underhanded manner by non-disclosure until the end of the process with the only options to accept or destroy the return created.

1 | First and Last Time Using TurboTax I've used TaxAct to file my taxes every year for the last 10 years and have never had a problem. For some reason, I decided to try TurboTax this year and it was a horrible experience. I will say that the first time through it was pretty easy to input the data. However, it started adding random things that it wouldn't let me remove, like an additional state return and a form for a credit I received in the past and both were completely unnecessary. Making changes to the tax forms outside of the wizard is so unintuitive that I had google how to remove them. It also messed up one of my children's SSN's and caused my return to get rejected. Somehow the information on the actual tax form that I saved was correct, but it managed to change one digit in one of the SSNs in the data that was submitted during e-filing. And the kicker...all of this cost me $145!!!! WTF??? I've NEVER paid more than $50 to file both federal and state, but to have paid this much for a horrible experience is completely unacceptable. The only reason I didn't do my taxes over in TaxAct is because I was in the process of moving and doing a lot of traveling during tax season. I will be ACTIVELY encouraging everyone I know to stay far away from TurboTax and migrate over to TaxAct.

2 | Misleading Misleading signup page and constant prompts to purchase the *Deluxe* or *Premier* versions. I ultimately purchased the deluxe package because I had $5 in capital gains. After discounts I paid $45 for that. 



I had to fill out the forms twice, because I must have hit the premier version at some point and there's apparently no going back from that.



I now have a splitting headache. I bumped the stars from 1 to 2 because I guess it's done? Misleading tactics, time consuming | 64006179|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1035

1 | It's the 21st Century - This should be easier I've been using TurboTax for 16 years now but some things are driving me up the wall. I'll focus on AMT and Filing Status. 



I paid AMT for my 2014 taxes and for 2015 TurboTax is saying I might save on my taxes for this year if I recalculate my 2014 AMT - seems easy enough but it requires TurboTax 2014 to be loaded onto my computer. I lost my 2014 disk so I can't do that so my alternative is manual which really means I'm not doing it. Here's how I see it, I paid for 2015 and if recalculation of 2014 AMT is part of 2015 filing then that should have been included in the software by default. I shouldn't need be asked by the software if I want to do this calculation, it should be done automatically - it's the 21st century...



Second issue and in my mind an even bigger issue. TurboTax made the wrong recommendation for filing status. It recommended that I file married filing separately where in reality I saved almost $200 by filing jointly. The only reason I caught that is because I manually calculated my taxes and my wife's taxes with different filing statuses. I try it married filing separately, married filing jointly and alternating our son as a dependent between my wife and I. Here is what I expect from software in the 21st century; TurboTax should take all of our information for my wife and I, run every permutation automatically and ONLY AFTER I submit all of the information tell me what my tax liability is for every single permutation and make a recommendation based on those results. Don't worry, I don't care if it's 400 permutations, I will read them all if it's laid out in a nice tabular format.

1 | Will no longer use Turbo Tax I have used Turbo Tax for over 12 years. You have grown. Your customer service has not. Your inability to respond to your failure of credit card processing is a huge failure. 



There was a glitch in your system. You did not own it. Your customer service team was rude, unprofessional, and simply stopped answering the phone.

2 | Extra Fees That Feel Sneaky... I've used Turbo-Tax for years- and it's pretty much the same general user experience except: They've gotten really good at sneaking in "extras" and not really explaining if you need them or not. However, when you're in a hurry, and you just want to get through this (and I have a feeling they know this) well, Turbotax has become like that shiney new car you want- the next thing you know, you're paying A LOT more than you set out to when it comes time to signing on the dotted line.

I had to go back and force it to file Schedule C, then erase all of my expenses and retype them into the Schedule C by hand.

You also ask me if I want to pay the fee through my returns but don't tell me it's going to cost an extra $34.99 until the very end. This was A LOT different than last year. This was not done to me then and will not be done to me in the future because I will not be using your services again.

3 | Recommended A+ previous yrs, 2 complaints this yr I used to highly recommend Intuit TurboTax, especially the online web-based service, every year since I started using in a decade ago. Most parts of the service are the same or improved. However, a new disturbing trend has emerged: bundling of questionable third-party products you cannot easily opt out of and the requirement to give out sensitive personal data to said third parties. Specifically: Audit Defense is unavailable without agreeing to sign up for IDNotify and share your private information with them. It is advertised as a positive feature, that users are being "given" a free "bonus" for signing up, however it amounts to selling the user's personal data to a third party at the user's expense. IDNotify is not a bonus, it is the lowest bidder contracted to provide compensatory services to government employees who had their identity stolen from government servers in that recent fiasco. You can read the reviews from dissatisfied government employes online. This would not be a complaint, except that users are required to sign up for IDNotify to purchase Audit Defense. Intuit, please stop abusing your loyal and paying customers. If it weren't for the previous years of good service and respect for the Intuit founder, I wouldn't even be here writing a review, I would just have stopped using TurboTax products and gone with competitors or a CPA.



Other minor complaints:

System requirements state plainly that Safari 5 on MacOS 10.6 is supported, however it gives the browser not supported message when partway through preparing your return. If I didn't have another system handy I would have been stuck, but many other users might not have that luxury. True that it gets harder to support more and more systems, especially older ones, but good service shouldn't just be for the wealthy and technically-inclined. Mostly this complaint is about the page that says it isn't supported linking directly to a page that says it IS supported. Strange coming from a company known for its good user interface...



Also, seems to be less and less support for downloading older returns and the associated paperwork. Used to be everything was available, but now seems only PDFs of the return itself for previous years. The whole point of choosing the web service over the desktop version (for me, at least) was I could get to my records any time, any place, even if a catastrophic event wiped out all my hardware and backups. If you want to amend a return or even just review the calculations used to generate it (which is ALOT of information that doesn't make it onto the return, but can be needed later), you must download the desktop version (again, with similar system requirements problems listed as in the complaint above). This, to me, defeats the entire purpose of having the web service. Why not just use the desktop version from the start if you're going to be stuck with it later no matter what?



I used to trust Intuit with something as sensitive and mission-critical as tax information because they were consistent year-to-year, provided intelligently chosen services, showed a long-term view, made visible effort towards security and privacy, gave attention to quality and efficiency in user-interface design, and all around behaved like a reputable and built-to-last company even in the face of rapid technological changes. I hope the above problems are corrected, not just because of the problems themselves, but because the pattern suggests a transition to the fly-by-night, short-term thinking that has infected other industries but really isn't sustainable when dealing with something trust-oriented like tax preparation.

1 | Disappointed in online purchase of tax program I have been a customer of TurboTax for over 6 years. I usually buy a CD, but last year I purchased the software online. I always purchase Home and Business, which allows me to do the tax return for our small business, as well as my 3 kids tax returns for no extra charge. 



This year I purchased the same program again, but the way the software was sold I was under the impression I was purchasing the download version. Unfortunately, it was just the online version. After I prepared and submitted my daughter's taxes, I was unable to do a second tax return. That was when I discovered that the "online" version only permitted one tax returned. I called customer support and was told since the taxes were already submitted there was no way to switch to the download version. As a result, I had to pay for the same software program twice. That is completely unacceptable. There should have been a warning at the time I chose the product that it only allowed one tax return. Hopefully next year the software purchase page will be more clear. Online version does not allow for multiple tax returns | 64005904|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1067
3 | Lose the ads or lower the price Why do I need to be presented with all Intuit products during something as important and exacting as a tax return?



My tax return required a paper filing. Why does the program use a third party app to present me with an option for printing/saving return for my records and not one to print for filing? Somewhere it says print the return for filing and then does a switch.



I've noticed this ever since they started using Adobe to print. Please, you can do better than that. Tax software doesn't need a rewrite every year. Throw an engineer on it. Ads for any and all Intuit products. Final print of forms is lacking | 64005898|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1068
3 | Turbotax 2015 the good, the bad, the ugly I have used Turbo Tax for many years, and I am finding that the program costs more and does a lot less. This year was minimally acceptable. It asked me questions that were not explained and which I had no or little basis to answer. There were three of four important times this occurred. 

The product has benefits but is getting weaker ( and considerably more costly) to the point that I will seriously be looking at alternate options for next year. If you are going to raise the cost of your product then yo had better add value to that.

There is more but I really do appreciate the opportunity to give meaningful feed back. Now I hope that you listen. 

I have been happy with the product until the last couple of years. It does not get all the information and asks some questions about things that already have the data for. | 64005894|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1069
2 | ok would have purchased disc again to import information. I did not want to retype all my entries. I have been using Turbo Tax for over 10 years. Much easier using disc, it imported all info every year, and compared every year. kept looping me between login and trying to upload prior years | 64005886|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1070
3 | State TAX I payed to have a TN return filed and TN does not require this.



I want a refund on the 39.99 that I could not move forward and skip.



That is ridiculous to even say something stupid like we filed your records with the state, are you joking me!!! that is a requirement of the employer and just a stupid charge. i will not use them next year if I do not get a refund!!! TN does not have to file tax returns!!!!! | 64005885|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1071
1 | So frustrating. Likely the last time I'll use TT. Each year the application seems to become harder to use. This is now at least my tenth year. I have a masters in tax law. I know what I'm doing; and this program is so frustrating. little flexibility to make changes. so awkward. | 64005883|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1072

3 | Mac user pain If you're like me and have a small/medium complexity business, there aren't a lot of choices out there. TurboTax Business isn't quite as simple or thorough as the personal products, but it's one of the only ways to avoid hiring an accountant to do your small business taxes. 



That aside, I really, really wish my friends at Intuit would either put this product on the Web or port it to Mac OS X. Of the four hours it took me to prepare my tax return this year, about a third was involved in getting the TurboTax Business product running on my Windows 7 virtual machine under VMware Fusion. Indeed, this is about the only thing I require Windows for - and every year, I dread installing the new version (but not as much as I dread visiting the accountant). TurboTax Business is only for Windows | 64005859|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1074
2 | State form review unsatisfactory. And other items If I were able to actually view my state form in TurboTax, I would have paid for the state form preparation. But I will NOT submit a state tax return if I cannot see it first, so that I can check on a few details. In my opinion, NO one should do so. TurboTax should advise the taxpayer of this situation BEFORE beginning the state tax process. Another thing, below you ask for more details. For "Your Family," TurboTax asks "Do you have kids?" That question needs to be more precise, in order for me to determine relevance. I have two kids, aged 40 and 42. Who cares? But if I answer "No," then I'm denying the existence of my (adult) kids. You should define "kids" or explain the relevance. Finally, I think it is ridiculous for you to provide the option to upload a personal image along with this review, because there is absolutely no value in doing so. Waste of time and ill-advised. Turbotax does not let the tax payer see the state form before filing. | 64005852|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1075

THEN you sent my returns ourt WITHOUT letting me Correct the lack of my NYS drivers license date NOWWWWW I am may get stuck with late filing.

1 | Horrible Product This Year! I have used TurboTax for years. This was by far the worst year for this product. I file with three states and so must purchase two states to complete the return. What is normally a smooth process of purchasing and downloading the added state software this year was a nightmare. Spent well over an hour on the phone with a really incompetent tech help who kept putting me on hold trying to get help. Then after an hour of making no progress she disconnected me while I was on hold. Had to call again and start again. This time the tech person just purchased it for me with my credit card information. Solved the problem but the solution was about 20 years out of date - give my personal credit card information to someone over the phone and let them manually do it for me?! What kind of technology company is this? Then this evening I am submitting the taxes online. Of course, I need to pay for two states for the e-filing. The TurboTax software sent me to pay for the state filing and the same thing happened again. A window pops up immediately telling me I have "timed out" and does not let me have online access to pay. I called in again but this time the recording told me I would have to wait for over an hour! The only alternative was to pay another $34.99 to have the funds withdrawn from my account. INTUIT SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND REFUND THIS ADDED $34.99 WHICH IS AN INSULT TO INJURY. I am so disgusted I am going to look for another way to do my taxes next year. A glitch in the software meant a loss of time and money! | 64005773|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1082
2 | Price too high $95 to file a simple return that I did myself. I could have paid a tax preparer the same price. The only items on this return was social security, small amount of interest, and nursing home reimbursement! Price too high | 64005770|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1083
3 | Software is too expensive I have used this program for several years and it has always been accurate. I just wish the cost was less and e-filing the state return was cheaper or free. Free is good Wish the state e-file was free or cheaper | 64005762|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1084
3 | You made Print Filing of taxes difficult Trying to file the forms by printing, COMPLETELY ended the ease of use. If you don't file electronically, you are not given ANY direction on how to print and submit the forms.



After reviewing my taxes, I realized that health insurance from my employer was too expensive for my family and changed the information in the program and it said that part of the penalty would be waived because part of my family was too expensive based on our income. However the amount was not changed in the amount of taxed I owe.



I believe this is an error in the programming. Changing information didn't change amount of penalties | 64005759|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1085

3 | Meh experience I typically have an easy time filling everything out for my taxes. But this year they added PLUS. and it was extremely annoying. i use turbo tax because its free and I'm a poor college student. but they asked me to use PLUS at least 4 different times which got on my nerves then to even put the icing on the cake. It was the free version but yet it still charged me 30 dollars. It didn't provide an option to go around it or anything. I had to then call customer service and wait an hour before evening getting to talk to someone. Im sorry but this use to be good but the trouble and the hassle i had to go through today was just annoying. this year was different | 64005739|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1088
1 | no better than a paper file & burning a $100 bill Frankly, the first disappointment was discovering that they lied last year when they said my costs would b deductible, Then despite having a very basic return I was charged over a hundred dollars for a return they say on the IRS site that they provide for free. I can't see anyone actually qualifying for the "FREE" filing they actually claim to offer. Bait and switch all the way, I cant promise anyone else is cheaper, but they can't cost more. overpriced, hidden costs, deceptive benefit declarations | 64005705|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1089
3 | Always hidden charges They never advertise the service as costing what it actually does, which is $100. They constantly bombard you with "additional purchase options" for all sorts of extra things they sucker you in to believing you will need.

1 | Couldn't file state online due to military 1099 We got trashed over this year and I'm angry! Turbotax waited until the very very end - when trying to efile - to tell me that I couldn't efile due to my husband's military retirement 1099. Couldn't tell me when I entered the 1099-R. Nope - didn't know until trying to efile at 7pm on April 18th. So had to print off the return, include a check, and go stand in line for an hour so it would be postmarked tonight. 



Should have notified me as I was going thru the return that it couldn't be efiled. Not happy. Been a longtime customer - that will most probably change now.  | 64005652|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1099

1 | Good program but pricing is confusing!!!!!! I have used turbotax for several years and this year I purchased the deluxe version from best buy and not online because it said on the box that I got a state free and then 19.99 after that. now that i'm ready to file 44.99 for each state. Now that it is the last day, I'm either stuck with paying 44.99 or you can tell me how to do it for 19.99. To many prices for the same thing!!! | 64005580|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1108
2 | Easy to use but Expensive This may be my last year using TurboTax. They have gone up considerably. I have a simple return and it cost me $119 with state filing. It's gone way up over the last year. Very Expensive | 64005575|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1109
3 | Extremely Cumbersome would like to see the on-line version become easier at adjust entries directly into the form. Very difficult to find specific forms and go directly to the cell.



Also, can you add email or text reminders for the customers who purchased TurboTax but have only submitted an extension to pay. I paid for your software and it didn't have the courtesy to remind me about the October 15th deadline, Now I am scrambling to get my taxes complete for last year. extremely cumbersome to make changes to a specific file. | 64005574|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1110

3 | Great software BUT.... BIGGEST complaint is, it doesn't run natively on Mac OS. So once a year, I need to boot Parallels to do my taxes. This workflow becomes a security issue because us Mac users who don't use Windows, don't necessarily keep in the loop about PC malware, viruses, Trojan, etc. Opening an operating system once a year also opens up a can of worms to potentially unsafe net.

3 | Grrrrr! Your pricing is ridiculous. Every year your cost gets higher and higher. I started off with selecting FREE taxes, which btw you brag about all over the place before and during tax time, but then I ended up paying about $95.00 by the time I finally sent my taxes in. I kept declining the extra services but ANYTHING outside of someone who is SINGLE with no deductions ends up paying $29.99, and if they want to add State, it's another $29.99, and then if you happen to wait last minute to do your taxes, like a LOT of people do......you find all this out at the END of doing your taxes. For those who don't have almost $60.00 at that point, TURBOTAX will offer to take it out of your tax return, for ANOTHER FEE of $34.99!! You guys CHARGE YOUR CUSTOMER to PAY YOU out of our own tax return. I was annoyed with the $60.00 at the end, but when I saw you charged $34.99 to for me to allow you to take your fee out of my return.......that.......well, it's pretty greedy IMO. A lot of people depend on their tax returns for financial relief, or go on treat themselves ONCE a year, and for you to rake them over the coals with charge after charge, it's ridiculous. Anyway, a little ticked off on the surprise charges but outside of that.......your software is simple and convenient to use. Expensive | 64005525|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1113
1 |  Every year the cost continues to rise...you advertise free federal return...then I end up having to pay $40 because I own a house and it results in an itemized form...I have no investments or other items...just the house...then I am charged another$40 just to e-file my state...it used to be free for the first state if you were charged a fee for federal...and at most it was an additional $15...now by the time it is said and done I have paid $80 for what I can just go and pay someone to do. Will use Taxact in the future. I have changed before and learned my lesson again this year for trying to use turbotax. The cost | 64005519|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1114

3 | Great at Tax Forms, Not so great at Payment Method The tax return was what I've come to expect from TurboTax. When it came time to pay, I opted to pay from my return. The process involved getting an ID code sent to my email. I discovered later that it went to my 'trash'. As I began to panic, evening of the 18th, I tried to go back to the options of payment methods with no luck. I went on-line and Googled TurboTax Suport. 800 number worked, but 3 hours from deadline and an estimated 30 minute wait. This did give me time to calm down and explore the intereface. I had gotten back to the payment method on the menu bar, and changed payment method to a credit card. No More Problems.

MY ADVISE: pay with a card! About gave me a heart attack when it wouldn't let me pay to e-file | 64005506|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1116

3 | Filed... I won't lie, I used TurboTax mostly out of laziness. I have a really simple return that I couldn't be bothered to file on my own. Filing was quick and easy, but there were a lot of "convenient" options that would have ended up costing me a lot more if I had not been paying attention. Overall - I'd say my experience was average, which was just fine with me. lot's of ways to get tricked into spending more than you thought | 64005442|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1120
2 | PLUS not worth it I opted for PLUS because I didn't have my W2s in front of me, and was figuring it would import it for me. Did not happen. I paid $30 for nothing.  | 64005440|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1121
3 | Tax is Done for 2016 but pocket is empty Overall Turbo Tax gets me through our taxes each year and is very convenient.



The cost seems to go up year after year. I am a consultant for a company which is being considered self employed but it is a side job that I have not been too active in and the program would not let me file through the deluxe. I feel that consultants for companies that make under a particular amount (or anyone with a smaller second, side, self employment type job) be able to utilize the deluxe at the lower cost vs. having to file under the full blown "Business" version. 



Again, thank you for making an easy to use program available on-line. It is nice to do it all right from home and no writing and mailing.



Thank you

1 | Portland Arts Tax Glitch I spent the last SEVEN hours of my day unsuccessfully trying to submit my return because of your Portland Arts Tax glitch, this includes an hour and a half on hold (with an estimated wait time of 35 minutes) Thankfully I FINALLY looked up to see if anyone else was having the same "Sch A" problem and found through PAGES of "angry" reports, a way to delete my entire state tax return (AGAIN- I ended up going through it FIVE TIMES thinking I was messing something up--thanks for that!) and start over and FINALLY submit.

3 | Fast but flawed Last year I did a lot for freelancing, so my return reflected that. Well, when TurboTax imported that information I couldn't, for the life of me, find the section where I could remove my vehicle's information.



What would be handy is in the Double Check at the end, there was a button that said "Take me to this section of my taxes". Alas, it doesn't exist and I shuffled through the buttons 3 times before I gave up and just put Zero for all the fields.



Hope I don't get audited! Wrong previous info hard to change. | 64005372|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1127
2 | Frustrating I've used TurboTax for about 17+ years and this was by far my most frustrating tax experience in all that time. Even though I've used the business version of the s/w for a long time, it was happy to let me process everything in the personal version and not complain until I was almost finished, then I had to go back and do it all over again. At several points it complained about items then gave me non-descriptive errors that lead me to figure it out for myself. Yeah,perhaps I messed up in a couple of places, but it was VERY happy to let me do so and then wait until the end before telling me to go back and do it again. It felt like a sad game of "Simon Says". 8 hours later, I'm done... Will be happy to let you mess up and tell about it hours later | 64005371|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1128

1 | Ok compared to last year. Last year was horrible. Turbo tax allowed someone else to file my wifes taxes and put us through a world of mess. So, this year was great compared to that.

1 | Changed without notification I will no longer be using Turbo Tax. After almost 10 years I found out you can no longer access prior year returns without paying an upgrade fee. So you pay upwards of $200 to use the service and can't access your returns without paying a second time. 

Not only did they change the policy,there was no notification of the policy changing. Forms should be easily viewable | 64005321|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1133
1 |  The software was poorly put together and very hard to follow to say the least. I made me get the turbo Tax Deluxe, when I did not want it. I had to get my taxes done today since it is the last day. This really sucked. I kept hearing I could file for free. The Turbo tax I used was for you to file for free. It's the free addition. The only reason I came here is to save money. If I would have went in to the tax office it would have been 99.00 to file this late. Since, I had been use to their prices I wanted to save money. I did get the intended purpose for using this program. And when I called they left me and a friend on the line for hours and hours!!!!!!! This was a very dissatifying situation and very stressful.

1 | Paid twice for two filings - Beware Be certain to download and don't use on-line version. I filed my daughters first on her computer and did it on-line. Then at home i couldn't get the version to download so to upload, I had to pay again. Premium is supposed to support 5 filings. Also, using the on-line version for her less complicated version, I entered the data 3 times and got 3 different refund amounts. Found out some data was entered but system wouldn't log (Home interest, property taxes, dividends). I had to delete and re-enter elements (like Div forms). Absolutely flawed software. Wouldn;t accept data - typed it in and then it showed as 0. Had to delete sub-record and re-enter to get it to work. | 64005301|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1135

But I was actually being tricked into paying an upgrade fee. Without completing any other transactions I called turbo tax to get a refund and was told I couldn't and that i could enjoy the benefits of the upgrade I didn't want for a year or so. I should've been given a refund and next year I won't be using turbo tax or any other tax system I'll be using a pen and paper. Shady | 64005226|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1142

1 | First and Last time user So I got this through Uber, was told by turbotax it would be $65 +$36 for state filing, ended up being $85 + $40 for state filing. Right off the bat this obviously irritated me, but I was still in it to win it so I kept going. The first part made sense but then the software kept moving my w2 information into 1099 categories. It did this 4 times, then merged both into one completely new business (that was named something I've never even heard of before) fast forward 2 hours and I finally fix this. Another hour and I'm done. This isn't the worst software I've ever used, but for something that costs money it's a huge FU to consumers. Charged $20 over the already high amount it claimed it would charge me, poor flow | 64005205|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1145
1 | Left out many details I had been very happy with turbo tax, however, this year I am extremely disappointed. I had to have a tax payer id because of fraud, and nowhere in the run through did it ask for one. Than I attempted to file with mine - again all the program asked for - and rejected again. I had to add my wife's taxpayer number.... Than I was rejected again because I haddecided I was going to file my daughters 1040 ez by mail in lieu of additional fees - and because she previously filed - I was reject again and had to send by mail. Next year I will print my own forms on Irs.gov and forgo turbo tax. Skipped details which delayed my returns | 64005203|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1146

1 | Nickel and Dimed to Death! I only use Turbo Tax because there's no better option. Every year they find more ways to get even more money out of this poor college student's pockets. $40 for this, $55 for that, $35 to process my return. Where does it end? Last year they didn't send in my state tax return and I had to pay hundreds in late fees. After speaking with numerous foreigners who have no idea how the US tax code works they refused to even admit they were wrong with picture proof that I had paid for my state return to be filed. This year was just as frustrating. The rest of the process. I am charged for every little thing. I paid over $130.00 in fees when my return is under $400 | 64005159|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1151

Whether it was issue transferring from 2014 or starting it with the Personal version and upgrading to the Business one... don't know. Navigating the various sections was a pain too, just let us go into specific areas instead of doing one question at a time and having to go through a bunch of them just to get back to what we need to change.



When it checks the return at the end finds issue in various forms, just have a link right there to delete the form or jump into the section where we can change the values. At least then if transfer didn't work well we can go through the prompt. Right now you have to manually go back to personal or business and find the right section to redo.

1 | bait and switch Work on itemizing for an hour only to be met with a message saying all of the info you input will be deleted and you will start from scratch....unless you buy turbo tax deluxe for 54.99. 

Get a refund then hope to just use refund for payment of the "turbotax deluxe" because I refused to go back and re input information that took me so long. Skip through the fine print (mistake) so after I basically finish the e file process it shows my receipt and there is a 34.99 charge for using my refund as a payment method....So I would have had to go alllll the way back to when they ask what payment method to use and re input more information or pay the 34.99 and keep all the info I just spent time putting together. 

So, I paid $90 to do my taxes this year....be more clear about what people are paying for, if the free version which I selected at the start does not include "itemizing"...then dont start the prompt getting you to itemize all of your credits and deductions if its not included in the first place.

Im not expecting to get a reply to this but from someone who isnt very educated on taxes I really wish I didnt use you guys again (this did not happen last year). You tricked me into paying $90 more than I should have, that is disappointing considering how large of a company you are.

1 | Bad for Out of State Rentals I have used Turbo Tax for years with no problems. I have had to work with rental properties and HUD settlement statements for refinancing or purchasing a new home before. This year is the first year I needed Turbo Tax for an out-of-state rental. I needed to list my expenses and assets for depreciation using my final settlement statement. Turbo Tax totally disappointed me. There is too much confusion when it comes to deductions for a rental using the HUD-1 settlement statement. The Turbo Tax Community was pretty much worthless because everyone gave a different answer. When I called for clarification I stayed on the phone for over an hour and got no answer so I hung up. The wait time was supposed to be 50 min. I won't be using Turbo Tax next year!

1 | Very Frustrated I cannot believe how many times I needed to sign about an upgrade. Now I have to check by credit card so I don't get multiple charges can't believe how many times I was asked to upgrade | 64004930|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1174
1 | Very sloppy This program use to be a lot more precise, accurate, legitimate, secured etc. Granted how many times it advertise how improved and better it is. Regardless of me using this program for a couple years in the past and now this last use for my 2015 return has really disappointed me not seeing the refund I am use to seeing. I don't feel secure using it as far as the security of personal info is processed. This program would process big bird and mickey mouse and then tell you it reviewed everything 100% and everything looks good but if you upgrade to max, we will secure your info but max has the exact same benefits as the recommended standard. My taxes have become a little more intense this last year so I would not recommend this for you. This program has become very sloppy, (Be careful). by the end I ended up paying about $100.00 just to file when I owed which was a H&R Block rate. This is definitely the last time I will ever consider using turbotax. I am sure there was an error or two with my returns but my time has exceeded and had to file  | 64004913|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1175
2 | Better than HR Block but still needs work Last year I used TurboTax Online and it was expensive. This year I went with the CD-ROM version which is cheaper than TT Online and is the only non-online version that supports both PC and Mac.



Filling out the federal tax return was mostly a breeze, except for entering my K-1 info which is never explained clearly enough in the software and requires referencing IRS documents.



E-filing the federal return went smoothly.



Unfortunately, the state return was a nightmare. It imported incomplete information from the federal return and did not properly guide me through the missing info. I ended up getting prompts that had blanks which were not filled in, like "Is this for?" I'm not sure if it was referencing a year or a person or what. Even worse it only prompted me once total, not once for myself and once for my wife.



When I clicked all the way through, it said it found errors but it wouldn't guide me through them properly. I ended up having to switch to form view instead, which pretty much made the entire exercise of using the software pointless because I could have just as easily filled out the forms by hand, and would have felt more confident that everything was filled out correctly. Still had to reference IRS website for K1 instructions, State return did not properly import data, prompts were broken | 64004885|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1176

2 | Couldn't efile because healthcare area is wrong! Healthcare questions are incorrect. There should be an option for a person with dependents to claim one person as having healthcare under Obamacare while the dependents are covered by their other parent under a work place plan. They are still my dependents but their insurance is provided by my ex-spouse. No option to indicate that so everyone had to clumped under Obamacare and the social security numbers did not match the 1095-A form. This prohibited me from filing electronically. No way to get around it. Healthcare area is not correct | 64004743|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1183
2 | Gets the Job Done Overall, it's a quick easy process to file your taxes. Getting deeper into it, it will ask you to upgrade to the non-free version every other page. Last year i paid for the lowest level and saw no difference in my tax refund compared to the free version. There are also some parts of the US tax code that are not exactly clear when going through turbo tax (re: ira contributions). self-promotion and promises | 64004728|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1184
1 | Beware of price!! The price was way too much for my basic taxes with no way to make changes. I have used Turbo Tax for years and this is the first year I needed to use the simplest form but didn't realize the price until the end. Very deceiving and disappointing! I will NOT use TurboTax in the future. Overpriced!!! | 64004727|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1185
3 | Home Business Difficult To Use I bought home and business because I purchased a home this year. The documentation said I could deducted loan origination expenses, but the program had no way I found to do so. In business for the schedule C there is no way I found for the program to allow me to deduct the simple home office deduction on form 8829, There is a space on the form, but Turbo Tax doesn't allow for its use. Would not let me go back and correct some errors | 64004726|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1186

1 | DECEIVED!!! It says free but after you spend a great amount of time entering all the info it tells you that you must pay $54. I did not want to upgrade to deluxe but they would not let me file any other way. I'm a single, student. There shouldn't be any special, difficult tax forms. It should be simple filing. They lie and deceive when they advertise free. They couldn't stand not to get a piece of my income tax return. Will use H&R Block next year. Same price and they help me. You get nothing for free!! You spend hours trying to figure this out then they tell you that you need to upgrade $54 | 64004715|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1188

3 | Had a problem Usually I'm very impressed with the software, and things go one without a hitch. I tried TaxCut in the past, but it didn't handle my K1 as well as this software. But this year I had a problem with the California tax return. I accidentally clicked the wrong choice the first time through, and it kept charging me the "California Use Tax" (for people who bought things online and didn't pay sales tax). I went back and fixed it over and over, and that tax would not go away. I tried calling the help line, and the wait was between 60-90 minutes. Somewhere around 40 minutes it disconnected me. I just filled out the 540 by hand and left the Use Tax out. Annoying. Met a bug on tax day, wait for help was over an hour | 64004693|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1190

2 | Works okay, but... This year TT posts only X's on the Federal return and leaves the State return blank. There is no way to get a hard copy or PDF of the return with the bank numbers. Tech support was no help. Last year TT left off the bank numbers from my State return and I had to pay a late-payment penalty by the time I figured out what had happened. The penalty was more than if I had gone to a Tax Adviser to prepare the return where I could have gotten relief for this error. I will be extremely upset if this occures again -especially if TT screws up my Federal return also. Which i point out again, there is no way of knowing until it is too late -- that is, you get a late payment penalty letter. Issue with bank account numbers, answers unavailable | 64004682|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|1192
3 | It works Overall my rating is average. The software gets the job done, but it could be improved. I am an accountant, and it is hard to get to a specific place in the return to adjust a number without going through the same questions again and again. The 2015 software did not populate the prior year data. I could never figure out how to populate the Tax History Report information for prior years, even though I had the data from the 2014 paper return. Also the SchA 5b, general sales tax calculator is not user friendly. The IRS website has a much better and reasonable calculator for determining whether to use Income taxes or general sales tax. This is an area I think you need to improve. I will say that the cost of the software (CD) is reasonable. We purchase the software every year from Costco and the price is very competitive. It is great that the efile for Federal is included in the cost of the software-Thanks. It is hard to get to a specific place without having to go back and answer the same basic questions again. | 64004681|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1193
1 | Extra useless fees for everything - waste of money I'm so sick of the hidden fees and extra money for every possible feature. In order to pay back money I owed I needed to pay TurboTax 39.99. In order to deduct the payment for their service I had to pay another 39.99. By the time I was done any refund I got was tied up in fees to TurboTax. Next year I'm going to file sooner and have it done by an accountant that I trust and pay them for less hassle. I'll keep the money local and not spend it on Intuit. They are a waste of money!!! After using them for a decade or more I'm fed up!!! Hidden fees at every turn | 64004657|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1194

3 | Program works well Overall, the program works. It walks you through the process and you answer the questions. It's quite simple.

1 | what a ripoff I had an easy tax to figure with just a few uncertainties. Used TurboTax last year and it was easy convenient and free. Decided to use it this year instead of the local free tax places I used to go to because using TurboTax was easier and much more convenient.



To my surprise, TurboTax was not free this year and full of ads for its products! They didn't tell me that It wasn't free this year until all the forms were done and it was time to pay. To top it off my taxes were EASIER than last year. I ended up having to pay more than my tax refund for something I can't even deduct from my taxes next year. I was charged because of 1 item NOT put on my tax form (because it wasn't needed) but the IRS required on a 1040 form according to TurboTax. I was so angry and frustrated that I stopped several times to see if this was some mistake, did I miss something? I couldn't go some place else to have it done free because all the time slots were already full. When I finally came back to finish, THEY RAISED THE PRICE!!!!! That really made me angry! But by this time I was so frustrated I just wanted to get it over with. Way to make easy money TurboTax!



I still don't know why I just didn't send in the forms I had already done myself.I always do my taxes by myself and then have them done elsewhere to check my work.



I used TurboTax because they sent me e-mails reminding me that I had used them last year. I don't recall seeing anything in the e-mails suggesting policy changes. Nor did I see anything on the site when I first signed in from the e-mail. They could have asked questions up front to let me know that I didn't qualified for free taxes. They also could have posted that the policy had changed on how one could qualify for free tax prep.



 I am pretty sure unless TurboTax changes its way of doing business I will not pay them to do my taxes again. kept raising the prices | 64004610|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1197

I was a bit late on my return as I was waiting for a HSA deduction form. Turbotax credit card payment gateway decides to break down as I am submitting my tax return forcing me to pay an additional 35$ to deduct from federal return.



Additionally, the "State Preparation is included" in the product description was not clear. Ended up paying an additional 25$.



Besides unanticipated charges... Great Product ! Credit card payment gateway broken on tax filing date. Forced me to pay an additional 35$ to deduct from federal return. | 64004582|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1199
1 | Should not have to pay for upgraded service Turbotax is a powerful, user-friendly set of tools. I have used it for multiple years running. Due to a change in circumstance for 2015, my return was simpler than in the prior year. I started using Turbotax "Deluxe", believing that my situation with student loan interest would require forms that take me out of the 1040EZ or 1040A categories. When I was totally finished, and after having been made to pay $55 for "Deluxe", I was able to actually see my return, and noticed that it is a 1040A. So, in fact, I could have used the free version. But I had tried to exit the unfinished return and couldn't "get out" of it. Since I was logged in with my profile, the program would not even let me start over (even though I did not want to, I would have, to save $55).

Word to the wise: always start with the free edition. If your circumstances require you to file a more complicated return, the program will tell you.  | 64004569|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1200

1 | Faked out As a veteran user, I was comfortable using the software like several times before. This year though, I apparently didn't finish the process when I was printing the return and wrapping things up. I just happened to check my bank statement today, looking for my rebate and couldn't find anything. So then I checked my return and it was at a status short of actually filing. Not a pleasant surprise. I realize that I am ultimately responsible for completing the process and I was probably too comfortable with the whole thing, but I would appreciate a stronger prompt to work through to completion next year.

2 | Good product slowly but surely going down hill I've been a TTax user for since the 90s -- including working for Intuit for a few years. What was once a great product although a bit painful to use, has now become a mediocre product that attempts to sugar coat everything. There's basic issues they've never figured out (like too much white space on pages leading to unnecessary clicking and scrolling, breaking up simple topics over multiple pages leading to unnecessary clicking and scrolling, or forgetting to default standard questions leading to (well, you get it)). But the more fundamental issue is they've hidden all ties between entries and forms. Knowledgeable users used to be able to dive into their return at any point and understand better what was happening -- understanding a series of white washed questions can't deliver in many cases. Its this white-washed UX that is the fundamental problem as it leaves the user feeling disconnected from the process. Your only option now is 100% trust in the product.

THEN you also have to mail forms?? No one told me about this! It's 7 pm the night of the deadline, everyone just got off work, no one has seen a stamp in five years... this is ridiculous.

1 | I Miss You 2014... I personally liked the old version of Turbo. This new version was glitchy and the sales tax portion wasn't operating correctly. Additionally, I found it oversimplified to a point where I became concerned about getting audited. However, the oversimplification did allow for speedy filing, though I'm still uncertain as to whether or not this is a good thing. Thus, I ended up just taking the standard deduction even though itemization was a higher deduction for myself. I miss the old version as I felt it allowed for more detailed entries as well as provided more detailed explanations. Perhaps this is merely perceptual, but I preferred it. As for TurboTax in general, the rates are too high and I feel as though if your signed up and you've filed your taxes through them then they should have this on record always regard less of filing free. Most any website allows for this is you frequent them or have used their services. I'm to the point that I'm considering no longer filing my taxes with Turbotax, seeing as how I end up paper filing state anyways every year bc of the cost. If I were going to pay $30 to file state, I could just go to H&R Block and have them do everything. Glitches, New Format, Poor Explanations, & Costly | 64004329|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1218
3 | Successful e-file There used to be a link to see your entry on the actual form. You could make modifications and enter data there as well. Plus, my 2014 Tax info wasn't even close to what I actually filed. I have no idea where Turbo Tax got that info.

2 | Ground through TurboTax Intuit can't keep their hands out of my wallet pocket. It seems like every time I go to a different part of the program they want more money. Last year they suckered me into buying a state return I didn't need and wouldn't refund.



If it wasn't for the ability to import my old data which saves me a ton of time on my, and my mother's tax returns, I would switch to a competing product.

2 | Not nearly as good as prior years I have been using TurboTax for years. This year TurboTax was only for the simple tax person not the advanced. I started to just do my taxes the old way because Turbotax was so hard to use for me this year. One person at TurboTax was helpful. With much difficulty for both of us and much time, I was finally able to see forms. The next person was not helpful at all. I had already tried all she said to do without luck before I called. 

So, Good Bye Turbotax from me. I went ahead and filed with TurboTax but will amend my return on my own with IRS forms. Very difficult to go to "forms". You cannot edit nor add in forms. | 64004241|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1224

2 | Annoying and No Help Available I remember TurboTax being a lot easier and user-friendly than this. For instance, it said that I am not qualified for the Child Tax Credit, and when I hit "Explain Why", it didn't tell me anything as to why I didn't qualify. I had to look it up online to find out that since I had made less than $3,000 this year (stay-at-home parent), I wasn't eligible. There was no explanation like this on TurboTax website.



When I was filing state, TurboTax automatically entered in 2,100 in itemized deductions from last year, when I had zero itemized deductions. This could really screw someone's taxes up. Get it together, please. Your product used to be amazing. Now, it's as if the Basic customers aren't worth a darn because we're not shelling out money for the "better" options. No help available for Basic customers, deductions and whatnot aren't explained well at all | 64004211|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1227

1 |  Turbo Tax makes you feel like you've been had- they lure you in with a low price, then try to upsell you on a more expensive version after each section. 



I wonder how much research went into the rolling up numbers for the refund- look how much money I made! (I mean, how much money I overpaid the government throughout the year...)



The NC tax return charged 35$ to efile, but did not make clear that efile did NOT include a payment option. Instead, I was directed to an NC DOR website only to discover that once I've filed with turbo tax I'm out of luck- there is no online payment option once you have filed. Guess I'm writing another check. Thanks Turbo tax! too many click through screens, too many requests to upgrade | 64004201|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1229

3 | declining customer support I started at least 7 years ago using turbo tax and have always been a fan but my support is fading. MD help links simply took me to a MD tax prep book which is confusing at best. Worst is your pricing structure has continually increased and now you add ~$35 to efile and erefund. It has gotten to a point where for the first time I am going to shop around for an alternative. This year it was $270 to file using tax softward....no longer seems like a bargain. pricing structure and add ons | 64004189|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1231
1 | Confusing and repetitive. Not enough explanations First time filing in Wisconsin, filed Federal for 20+ years last 10+years with Turbo Tax. Gripe 1--There was not enough contrast to the rules of Federal vs. State. How am I supposed to know if I need to enter in an adjustment to the state if you don't tell me how it is different from Federal? I had to go to the Wisconsin website to figure things out. I am not paying money (2x) for not having the explanations readily available about how the state treats items differently . Gripe 2- Also it seems like I had to fill the state forms out 3 or 4 times. Granted I was switching between my kids forms but each time I logged back in I had to go through state information I had already entered and some of the information was gone. I am still not confident they are done right because the explanations weren't there. Hopefully when I go through them in the coming days I won't realize I need to do an amendment. Gripe 3--I hate that I can't see how Turbo Tax has filled out the forms until I am ready to file. Maybe I'm missing something but it seems like you are getting further and further away from the forms just to make it impossible to check them. Gripe 4-- Also filling out my kids forms who only have Interest and Dividends used to be free and this year they charged me. This will be the last time I use TurboTax online. Can't see any part of the forms until paid | 64004166|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|1232

1 | Pushing additional services like a street hustler. The near constant re-asking to purchase the +Plus or deluxe features was VERY irritating. At the beginning of filing when declining to pay $29.99 for the +Plus service there was a cheap fear tactic in taking the user back to the previous page and having to watch each individual benefit and past saved info disappear/fade away. To think that some web designer specifically created the page to make a person watch and feel like they're loosing something is low. The convenience of online filing is great but I'd very much like to be treated like a sound headed adult, not an unsure idiot that needs to be re questioned on their decisions.

1 | Confusing TurboTax had me start through the Deluxe option before telling me that I had to pay for the service, then pay for filing both federal and state returns. When errors were found in my filing during Smartcheck, it didn't tell me how to fix them, and there was no help button. I had to research most of the questions I had on my own.

1 | Way Too Hard This is my first year downloading to my macBook Air, so maybe it's just that TT sucks with these vice a PC. Anyway, not only did the software miss errors (obvious things like duplicate dividend downloads from my bank), but also would not allow me to BUY a state e-file option. (did you get that TT? I don't expect to have to BUY e-file when I already pay a chunk with 'state included.') So the TT interface would not allow me to buy the e-file for state, thanks to some glitch, which wouldn't even let me log in to my TT account. I went to online support - nothing worked from that. I waited on the phone for 40 minutes, and I got hung up on. Just bad service. Very glitchy, very poor user friendliness, just a bad experience overall.

2 | Turbo Tax - Expensive to E-file The 1099B and the international stocks were confusing. Other sections were pretty straight forwards.



I just can't believe CA state e-file cost is $29.99 and you are forced to buy turbo premier for $39.99 to e-file federal tax. This extra cost is a total rip off after you spent $70 for the software. 



I'm seriously considering this year as my last year using the turbo tax. confusing on 1099B and international tax charges, expensive efile charges | 64004020|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1243

1 | 7yrs with Turbo Tax has ended I would have been a lifer with turbo tax. They made it ez and simple. This year I geared up to file my taxes online with TT and they informed me, with no warning, that I would no longer have access to past returns unless I paid 29.99 for their "Plus service." I continued with my 2016 taxes anyway only to be hit up again at the end with a 29.99 charge to file my state EZ tax form. 30 bucks for an EZ tax filing. No grading scale. Other tax prepares will do it for 14.99 for an EZ and one even offered to do it for 7.99, but you have to file your state (for Ga) with whoever files your federals. If ihad started a little earlier I would have been able to mail both for the price of a stamp. I have to say unless i hear from TT about this, it will be my last year with them. Loyalty means nothing to large companies anymore. They want $60 for basic services and with the way they pulled this next year you may have to pay $50 to access last years and $50 bucks to file state. overcharge for state EZ filing, Surprise 2016 over charge for access to past years. | 64003917|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1255

Does not explain how the tax is calculated. I had to research online why my Turbo Tax Tax liability was greater then IRS table suggests. Upgrade to premier promised support from an accountant and greater detail for stocks transaction. I paid extra $30 and did not see a difference. Complete waste of money on the upgrade. I used turbo tax for the last 7 years and as my tax situation becoming more complex the more disappointed I am in Turbo Tax. Does not explain how it calculates tax liability.

I still pay the fee for itemizing, but, I get a minimal refund and am thankful. This year, I choose not to pay the additional fees and just file an EZ form. Amazingly, I suddenly need to itemize or I will owe. Therefore, i have no choice but to pay the additional fees and to itemize.

1 | Annoying, frustrating So in filing my state taxes this year I discovered there was a credit available. In order to get the credit I had to enter in specific information from last years return. I couldn't access that info without upgrading my account with Turbo Tax first. I understand that, but the website wouldn't let me get to the point where I could pay this fee. I saw the option to deduct it from my return, but to pay the upgrade fee and receive last years return info was an exercise in futility. I ended up forgoing the 500$ credit because Turbo Tax was taking hours of my day and I just went around and around with this stupid website where they try to sell you every little thing. Annoying and frustrating.



Obviously the lesson is to keep all your return info, but if Turbo Tax is offering to help with that I'd take it. However it wasted 4 hours of my day and I walked away from a nice credit, because it was driving me insane.

1 | Repetitive questions Very difficult to use when last year cpa filed and didn't supply PW/PIN info. Did not have printer available and unable to print but couldn't eFile. Therefore tried to use extension but that was a joke also. Only thing it did was cost $54+ dollars really for nothing.

3 |  mostly ok but the additional 5$ left a bad taste after going all the distance. I didn't see any additional charge notice. You hit my account for my federal taxes and get the use of those funds for two business days and tell me how great you are.

1 | Meh....Not as good as it was I am not so thrilled with the software anymore. I find it does not "assist" you with easy step by step question and answer as it did in the past. At the last step of reviewing my federal form it found an "error" in a 1098 form but would not allow me to correct it or re-start my taxes, just an endless loop or error and not being able to correct it. Very disappointing to say the least. I had to call customer service for a refund! I will never use TurboTax again. Not so intuitive, Had some bugs | 64003350|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1296

1 | Too Many Additional Fees I will not use Turbo Tax ever again. I spent over $129 to prepare my taxes!! One fee for state, another for adding a 1099, and one to have my money placed on a card.

3 | what's up with state? Once I saw the $24.99 for filing state, then an additional $34.99 for refund processing fee, I promptly withdrew this return and filed direct to California for $0.

1 | Paying for Lobbyist to Keep Taxes Complicated & $$ Firstly, I only used Turbo tax b/c they offer deducting filing costs from refund only to find out that they charge $34.99 for the service! Really?! How can you reason that? 

Additionally, I despise the fact that Turbo Tax Intuit is spending millions of dollars to send lobbyist to DC to sway Congress from simplifying the tax process! I was desperate so I used Turbo Tax but never again ...you are a greedy, greedy company and the $34.99 fee for paying with my own refund money is proof. Being charged and add'tl $34.99 for have filing costs deducted...really?! | 64003203|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1311
3 | No separating the federal and state returns I feel like TurboTax reeled me in. They had me go through all the steps to prepare the federal return and then they automatically transfer the information to the state return, but I don't have to file my state return until May 2, so, therefore, I didn't want to go through the entire process with the state and have no choice but pay the fee for filing the state return. Didn't have the option to not also prepare the state return. | 64003185|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1312

2 | Gotten very greedy and less user friendly Lacks intuitive thumbnail tips whether you should go thru the trouble of entering so many answers and then just get standard deduction.

2 | Good Product (A bit pricey)... I participated in a research project in 2014, but not 2015.

After 20 attempts I got it to file, but it is not correct. Please fix, so it doesn't cause future problems.

1 | Hidden filing fees and manual steps for states Corporate greed is making Intuit hide fees for state filings - you get state tax software, then you pay again for e-filing. When you e-file (I filed to NC) - you have to pay separately using State website or mail a check.

continuing with cons: too hard to tell where I was with filling out actual tax form lines/numbers. I couldn't get a handle as to where my answers were being inserted. the help menu info wasn't helpful - didn 't get the answers I was looking for. Tried asking for phone/email assistance and no one ever responded. Got a message that my state tax files were rejected, so I followed your "fix" prompts (a little vague what actually is done to fix the problem) and resubmitted, but don't' know what was wrong and if it was fixed. misleading info regarding which forms I should be filling out, incomplete information provided, too difficult to tell wh | 64003106|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1322

This year although I would save the data I entered, when I would open it back up, the data wasn't there. I'd have to re-enter it two or more times. YUCKY!



I hope you can fix these glitches, because I'd like to stay loyal to the Intuit Turbo Tax product. There were so many program glitches this year, it made the experience terrible! | 64003063|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1324
2 | ok but lousy for LLCs If I'd known how worthless it was for LLCs I'd have probably just used paper to file. Does not handle disregarded entities well, absolutely fails on important state forms for LLCs, it assumes LLCs have rentals (which is common but far from the only case). It should explicitly ask more about the entity and give better guidance into where to enter income, and should fill out the state forms (ftb 568, 3522, sch k-1, etc). does not handle LLCs worth a darn, esp in CA | 64003022|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1325

1 | Turbo Tax Horrible! I was very frustrated this year that marked as estimate cells can not be unmarked (none of them). Available help for a solution was lacking in any real expertise. My federal tax form was complete and ready to file, so I had to start from scratch to be able to file on time. It was also recommended that I delete my state tax form if I did not want to file it at this time, but it would be permanently deleted. What has happened to your once great product that I have used for years with minimal problems? Very disappointed in your lack of customer service!

Got to end and had a error in my state tax that referred to a sheet noting business expenses when I am only filing as an individual.

1 | Telemarketer for Taxes You don't deserve my review, but I'll give it to you, just this once.



I fully support making money in this country. I think it's great at hastening innovation, obviously only second to a great catastrophe. But to systematically reduce features year over year to make more money is atrocious.



Secondly, obfuscating the price of $34.99 for being able to deduct your state fee from the tax return? Whoever you paid for that well planned string of clicks, I hope has a catastrophe themselves.



I have used Mint through a majority of my adult life, and am never going to recommend it to my friends again. The second I can get off the teat with a competing business model, I will.



TL;DR

I don't like you.

2 | Getting Expensive and confusing I bought the version that SAID it included both Federal and one state for free....only to get charged to file for the state and get charged another 45 dollars plus another 25 dollars for the second state. So I spent about $200 dollars which is more than I paid an accountant last year. This will be my last year with turbo tax. Which is sad as I hate driving an 40 minutes to the accountant.

2 | Pricey This Year I remember when this service was about $30. It's good, but it's not worth $89, even with inflation. Next year I will be shopping, or buying the CD's if available any longer. The price to use has doubled this year. Almost 100 dollars. | 64002764|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1341
2 | Great product, costs are hidden until the end Very thorough. Excellent interface and navigation.

Waiting until the end to discuss the cost was a BIG negative. The service was listed as free for Federal and State. It was free for the Federal file and $29.99 plus tax for the State. Let's see free is zero, anything more than zero is NOT free! Charges for a Freefile? | 64002761|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1342
2 | Free....I think not! Received a variety of "Free" copies of Turbo Tax and decided to use the one from T Rowe Price. I was blown away by the $39.99 fee for State and e-filing. For some reason my daughter's was cheaper at 29.99, despite having two states. I probably would have been better off buying a copy of Turbo Tax at Costco and paying a smaller fee for e-filing.

3 | Turbo Tax Tips You should be more upfront about the cost of Turbo Tax. I thought I was getting a deal buying it through Costco but in reality, I got charged an additional 24.99 when I went to file the returns for "e-filing" which is ridiculous. 



In addition, I don't have a cd drive on my laptop but knew that they could allow me to download the product online -- this process took over an hour and the download wouldn't initially work. This was frustrating.



The only real positive I see is the depth of itemized deductions. I wouldn't think to deduct some things that they ask about. They didn't state that I'd have to pay a fee on top of paying for the cd product for e-filing. | 64002638|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1351

2 | Really need to bring back ability to view forms I've used TurboTax for probably 15 years. It used to allow you to examine individual forms, and even delete them. That feature no longer exists.



This year, TT generated spurious forms for stock sales that were "empty" - they were for sales of zero shares. I have no way to look at the list of forms generated and delete those.



Also, during the "check your return" phase, TT said I needed to fill in additional information on those spurious forms. But it was impossible from the "fix this error" dialog to determine *which* stock sale the dialog was referring to.



Bottom line: I need the ability to 1) see the list of actual forms generated, 2) go to a specific form and be able to edit it and 3) be able to delete spurious forms. Messages during return check are cryptic and useless | 64002612|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1353
1 | In-excusable Performance How could you let this happen? For two days now I have not been able to get access to your online order entry site to place an order to e-File my State return and to download my second state preparation file. I am trying to send you more money to get my taxes done and you won't accept it. I tried reaching you by phone today twice. The first time I got a return call pretty quickly but the man I talked to was no help. He admitted that you were having web site problems but offered no solution. I tried calling again later to talk to a supervisor and I never got a returned phone call even though I was told someone would call me in 50 minutes, So I have been chained to my computer all day trying to get this task done and now it is too late for me to get an extension form to the post office since I don't live in a big city. There also does not seem to be a way to file for an extension electronically if all you want to file is a state return extension. Fortunately I was able to file my Federal return electronically on time. I just can't believe that you did not do a better job of preparing for your peak season. There are all kinds of Internet Service Providers out there that would have provided extra capacity for you to be able to handle your heavy workload on tax filing day. Lord knows you charge your customers enough that you could have afforded to prepare for this day better! I have been a loyal Turbo Tax user for years but if this is how you treat your customers when we need you the most, I am looking for another service provider for next year.

2 | Mixed feelings The 50 dollar fee for having to upgrade to process a very simple form (1099-R) is ridiculous. Had it been a more in depth form, I could MAYBE understand. But not for mine. Also, when it asks "did you make money in another state" style questions, and I just entered that I did when doing my federal portion, that's quite redundant. It should already know that I did and import and adjust accordingly. I have never had a problem with turbo tax, but for the money that I payed to do it all myself basically, I will definitely be paying less money next year for someone else to do it.

1 | Misled and frustrated Imagine my surprise when, after paying $54.99 for the "Deluxe" service and filling out all the information for the state taxes, I found a message saying that "all the work" I had done on my state return would be lost and I would have to fill out my state taxes again on my own unless I paid an additional $39.99. C'mon, Turbotax! I had been very impressed by your product and service until that moment, and now I feel like I'm covered in a really sleazy salesman's slime. I will be calling customer service to ask for my $39.99 back. misled me about the charges | 64002492|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1364
3 | Easy but not free The only thing free about this site is the act of using it. After that, everything costs money. Costs just as much for me to go in and have my taxes done. OF COURSE I want to store my information, OF COURSE I want it deposited into my account and not get some stupid debit card. I started the process online with H&R block because I've used them since 2010. They were going to charge $40 just for filing state. But in the end, it all costs the same amount, you just rearrange where your fees go. You charge for one thing but not another, and another site offers one thing free but charges for another. I guess that's how you catch people. Expensive | 64002490|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1365
1 | Too Much Trouble The first few years I used Turbo Tax, I was impressed with the site. But the last 2 - 3 years it has just been more trouble than it's worth. I get emails telling me if I log in with my username & password that all my info from the previous year will be filled in; however, this is not the case anymore. This year and last year I know for sure that I had to manually fill in all our personal info, like name, DOB, SSN, etc., again. The website needs to be streamlined - some of the steps could be pared back. I understand there are newbies, those who have difficulty with doing their taxes, or have taxes that are very complicated; maybe have two options. I want a truly quick & easy way to file my own taxes, & this service is not it anymore. Also, there have been several instances when it suggested I do something one way, but when I hit the button to do the suggested step, it will end up doing it some other way. For example, my state & federal return got rejected, & after I corrected the mistake it suggested that I mail my returns instead of efile as I'd previously done. I clicked the button agreeing to that, but it immediately gave me a "checking for the best way to file" message, & told me the best way to file would be efile. It makes the service seem inept and untrustworthy. I could go on, but I won't. I'll just end by saying that this will be my last year to use TurboTax. There are several tried & true tax preparers in my community who will file my taxes for the same amount I paid to do it myself with this service, and they'll do it quicker & with a LOT less hassle.

3 | Beware Refund Processing Fee I had an overall positive experience until the payment screen when a magical "refund processing fee" was added to my bill.

3 | Prices I'm not unhappy with the service that I have received from TurboTax , generally its good service. However , due to circumstances unforeseen for me I had to file on the last day. Of course, there is always fine print. Also , I usually only have to pay like 30.00 for filing , this year it went up to $54.99. Of course, I wasn't happy about that because I have never paid this price. I personally think that jacking the prices up is outrageous.  | 64002469|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1368
3 | They dont make it easy Very difficult to file at the end. Tried to make it easy by doing a direct deposit , BUT THEN i had to know routing #'s and account #'s. This info i didnt have with me . So chose then to pay by debit card. I also did not like having to choose a card with confusing fees, ect. It made me afraid to ever withdraw my funds off of that gimmicky card. Scrap that option. So I opted for a good old paper check.....ahhhh deduct payment from your return= visa card headache | 64002450|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1369

1 | The Ad Situation has Gotten Out of Control I've filed my taxes through TurboTax since I began filing independently five years ago. This year is the first year I've seriously considered filing elsewhere. While I understand that selling overpriced Plus and Premium services is how TurboTax makes their money, it seems extremely dishonest of a company that prides itself on its simplicity to make it very difficult and confusing for a person to file their taxes for free. I'm a pretty tech-savvy person, so I could easily tell when saying "no" meant I was refusing a product, rather than refusing to file my taxes, but I could easily imagine someone like my grandfather getting confused and thinking he had to pay for services in order to get his taxes filed. Way to prey on the ignorant, TurboTax. Apparently taking candy from babies is your new business model.

Nice lady but her email advice to address my problem was off the mark. I called again and after another 45 got through to an expert whose email was spot on. DO NOT enter the 1099R there, go back and enter it "there". Problem solved. This was a rollover not a distribution, no tax deduction of 6,500 and no penalty for the amount in excess of 6500. I'd give that lady a 10 for 10 if she sent a survey. I was at wits end. The form was complex for my meager needs and took forever to finish, I will say Turbo Tax is thorough and CPAs will love it.

1 |  You added a fee for a state tax return that was not needed. You advertise that the federal tax return was free for my situation and that the only fee I had was the tools to keep my previous information. New Hampshire does not require a state tax return and no matter what I clicked you charged me, resulting in you take over $90 in fees when it should have only been $29.99. You trick people with these fees. At the end of filing you even sent me verification that my state did not require a tax return, yet still charged me for it. I would like that fee refunded to me in my direct deposit check.  | 64002402|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1377

2 | Great.....until Too expensive for a free program. I didn't mind the state fee, I could even shrug off the $50 fee for one number. 



I can't shrug off a $35 processing fee when they claim it is a free program. 



I always due my taxes by February, but this year I was late because of life circumstances. I had never done a 1099-misc before so I wanted some guidance. I'll never use turbo tax again because of the processing fee. 



Way to nickle and dime people. I use your app to organize my purchases, but I'm done with that too. I'll find a free one or I'll do it the old fashioned way. Supposed to be free, but they charge a $35 fee, plus I had to pay $50 to enter one number. | 64002381|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1379
3 | Railroad Retirement not so clear Been using TurboTax for years and found it works well, is easy, and complete. This year the pension section was after most of the less common forms of income and the Railroad Retirement section was hard to find on the Social Security line. The real problem was that the form 1099 and the form 1099-R incomes, and federal tax paid had to be added together to make the complete income totals. There were no instructions about adding them. I'm not sure that the turbotax form "realizes" that there are two different forms. RRB hard to find and didn't state clearly the additions necessary | 64002377|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1380

1 | Too Expensive, hidden fees I suspect I did not get all the deductions and credits I could have qualified for. A friend of mine used HR block and I wish i had also. At the end of my turbotax filing this year, I find out that they charged me for the deluxe addition ($54.99) when i had opted for the free edition, and they charged me the full price when i had found it for $10 cheaper on their site! Additionally, they charge $34.99 to file your state taxes, and on top of that when it was time to efile, they said that i couldnt efile unless I agreed to upgrade to the PREMIUM SERVICES PACKGE which is an additional $40! My total came to around $150 in the end, and during my tax preparation I had said my tax fees were only $34.99, because at that time i had no idea they were going to jip me like they did.



I hate using turbotax, and that says a lot coming from me because I have been a loyal user of turbotax for 10 years! not trust worthy, expensive | 64002367|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1382
1 | Too expensive I was unable to enter in a 1099-MISC without paying 54.99 just to enter it. It was a very simple document, had no tax deductions. Was simply Nonemployee compensation. Ended up spending as much to do my taxes online as I would have had I gone to a tax service. Had to spend 55 just to file federal, then another 40 for state | 64002360|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1383
2 | Hidden Fees I understand the fee for filing state, but with the free federal return I don't understand where the extra charge came from...surely it wasn't for accessing the little blips that explain what certain parts mean????? I just don't get it. And I am not stupid, have Master's degree etc, and think this is something that needs to be explained or let people know ahead of time that they will get charged.

3 | 2015 return Previous years turbo tax has been a breeze...this year did not seem to flow like past years...you've changed something, but I don't know what that is.

issues...in the business part it kept asking for "trade-in" information, even though I said I didn't have any trade-in.

At the end in review...just says enter this info you missed, but no explainations/instructions of what this item was or what exactly it was looking for. spent lots of time going to the section where we thought this was at...some places said to leave it blank, yet review kept telling me i had to enter something! some areas are confusing | 64002347|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1385
2 | Excellent - EXCEPT.... I do not like bait and switch. If you claim something is free, make it free. If you let me know ahead of time, before going through all the rigamarole to type everything in, I can decide for myself whether or not I want to continue. And I get it that you would probably say that the statement was 'free federal returns' or something to that effect, but you could and should make it crystal clear up front what the actual cost will be to do one's taxes. No gimmicks or gotchas. You stated "free" -- and then charged me $30 | 64002333|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1386
2 | Lots of things need to be fixed AFTER you pay. The program gave me the impression it was all done and all was good. I paid for it. AFTER that, they did a final check and found LOTS of things that needed fixed. This final check should be sooner, not after you think you are done.

3 | Turbo Tax Review - 2015 I have been using Turbo Tax for years. The software is easy to use, intuitive and has excellent help screens. I have never had an issue with a tax return. 



I do have one very big issue. The price of the State Tax Form has become extremely expensive. It is a simple add on. Having worked most of my career for technology companies, I understand the cost of Research and Development. Frankly, had I not procrastinated through 7:00 PM on the 18th, I could have easily completed my state return using the information compiled on my Federal Return. 



If the cost of filing a state return doesn't decline, I will be making every effort to prepare my state tax manually, and take the $40 and go drown my sorrows at how much I pay in taxes. Cost of State Tax Form | 64002170|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1393

1 | Turbotax screws you at the end with an extra fee Turbotax screws you at the end with an additional fee to a bank. Once you put in deduct the turbotax fee from my refund, you are stuck with the $34.99 fee to some pathetic bank. There is no way to undo your decision and just have it mailed to you.

I spoke to several people at Turbo Tax and was told "sorry, you should have filed when you paid for it. There's nothing we can do about." I had my order # and they agreed I had paid for it but I couldn't use my order.

1 | You'll pay My brother did his return from the Federal Web site and got the federal and state for free. I went directly to TurboTax and it cost me over $60. If I didn't wait until the last day I would have cancelled and used a cheaper alternative. I'll know bette next year. After the horrible stunt TurboTax pulled last year, I thought they'd have learned their lesson. Sure the Federal was Free, but the state cost me over $60 | 64001898|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1416
1 | Unclear Payment process isn't clear. There's a lack of information to prepare you for how the filing process will go. I had to request a payment plan but there was no warning that I would need to print and mail in a form. I don't have access to a printer. This was inconvenient.

2 | Problems with IRA Distribtuion I received only one 1099R for a gross IRA distribution. Most of the distribution was re-contributed within 60 days. Some was converted to Roth IRA, all of which I subsequently unwound. Trying to enter this into TurboTax was very difficult. Prompts led to inaccurate entries. Re: IRA contributions in the deductions section, need better explanation that "contributions" are only those amounts that come from external sources, e.g., savings. Recharacterizing a distribution is not a "contribution." I submitted a question regarding the above to TurboTax. Never received any response.

1 | Why I hate TurboTax TurboTax, like other tax companies, pull a classic bait and switch. Offering free filing and the like, only to pull the rug out at the last moment at any change in your income/status/lifestyle/income. I understand I may need premium features but this in no way affects my state return, so WHY CHARGE ME SO MUCH FOR IT? I am paying TurboTax about as much as the federal government which is messed up. I don't see the correlation between the product TurboTax advertises and the actual cost to use. Seems deceptive and will not be using in the future. Decieves you to spend more money | 64001633|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1435
2 | Helpful but surprisingly expensive I do not want to appear to bash TurboTax, because I do appreciate what it has to offer. I log in each year - and the program remember me. If I work for the same company, it actually imports the W-2 for me (awesome!) but yet each year, a fraction of my return is taken away from surprise charges by TurboTax. All of a sudden, you get to the File page and you owe almost $100.00 to file both returns (yes, they charge you separately). If you want to walk through step-by-step each possible deduction, they will deem that you are using the "Delux" version and you suddenly get to pay $50+ just to finish your Federal Taxes. I do not make a lot of money, but I do look forward to my return. TurboTax helps make the process easy and keeps it at a level that I can understand. However, the growth in popularity is evident as the growth in their charges rises each year. Pricey and not very simple. | 64001628|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1436

1 | Not Worth The Money...At All While it's faster than manually doing a return, for someone who has no investments, doesn't own a home and does't itemize deductions, using TurboTax is a waste of money. I have used it in previous years and paid either nothing or nowhere near what it cost this year! What they've done is this: features that used to be free or carried a small charge are now part of a 'premium' package so they can to try to justify charging, or charging more. This is completely unacceptable and I will never, ever use this software again. Did nothing I couldn't have done on my own (except saved time) and cost was gouge-level! | 64001587|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1441
1 | Not happy Last year, it cost me $30 to do taxes on Turbo tax. This year, it cost $120 because for some reason, it signed me up for Turbo plus and would not let me undo because I clicked on help (not knowing I was in Turbo plus). . I will not use Turbo Tax again. The first time I tried this year, it tried to charge me $60, so I abandoned it. Then I couldn't find a free software, so I came back and it charged me $90 that time. I cancelled again and came by hoping to get the $60 charge again, but it was $120 this time, so I just processed it to get it over with and made a vow not to use Turbo Tax again. Make it less easy to press the wrong thing and upgrade accidentally. Too expensive!! I could've bought a grill or a table for my deck with this money, but instead, Turbo Tax gets it. smh. Not happy.

1 | poor calculation of estimated state taxes I filed with TT for my 2014 taxes last year and used it to calculate estimated taxes for fed and CO state. I earned only 87% of what I used in the calculation but paid the full amounts. I overpaid the feds quite a bit and underpaid the state by a bunch, enough to cause a penalty from the state.

It also screwed up worksheets for K-1. And it included unneeded Scchedule E. It thought I had rental income, when that was never selected. Even after going in and redoing to make sure I did not mark rental income, it kept the extra workisheet. Ugghhh!

Also wanted to see what updating W4 would look like so I entered info but didn't finish. I had to go back and manually delete the inputs because there is no option to delete the whole entry at once. after 20 minutes on hold without reaching an agent, and an hour of trying to figure it out I finally realized I had to delete each input for the review tool not to give false alarm.

1 | Completely dissatisfied with TurboTax 2016 1. Turbotax did not update their software to handle the 1099 reporting for options. My brokerage used negative numbers as proceeds and brokerage firm said that is how IRS requires them to report it. When Turbotax expert/customer service was contacted the advice given was incorrect. The person asked me to flip the cost/proceed. I took the advice of my brokerage firm and entered all the line items with cost basis and proceeds manually (several hundred). What is the point of paying $150+ to Turbotax if I am spending hours doing this work manually??? Also, the customer service representative was RUDE.



2. Turbotax hires incompetent people who don't know what excess 401(k) deferral means. Spent 30 mins repeating the same information to the customer service representative. She took 30 mins to write down what I was saying and then said she took notes and will inform the expert who can answer my questions. After 30 mins she said she will transfer me to the expert now and I was on hold for 1 hour and did not get anyone on the phone. I finally hung up. To the best of my knowledge "Transfer" does not equal "Place on Hold"



3. I have used Turbotax since 1999 and it keeps getting worse every year and the price just keeps going up and I see that every year I am having to enter more and more information manually. I will not use Turbotax again. See detailed review | 64001381|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1453

I had to delete my whole account to file my federal taxes because once you fill out the form for state there is no removing it. disgraceful. slow, tricky, expensive, conniving, hard-sell, bait-and-switch | 64001317|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1457
2 | Disappointment I've used TurboTax for 10 years. Because of a major screw up, we didn't file taxes last year. When we realized "I thought you did it" meant no one did it, I immediately went on line to access Turbo Tax to file. I was told I could not access my historical data without buying the next year's version of Turbo Tax. I have always been able to access this information at any time in the past years. I bought what I was directed to, and still couldn't access it. Then I was told on the phone #after multiple calls and long conversations with obvious trainees# that the data was unavailable, and they were aware of the problem. Two months later, the same thing. Six months later, I still can't access it, and I believe it is because I ended up buying a desktop version versus the on line version. Whatever the case, I figured out how to get the information the hard paper way, but you can imagine the stress I went through trying to access this. I know I just filed for this year, and had to use Turbo Tax, because I bought every freaking thing I could to get my taxes done. I still can't access my historical data, but I don't have the time to get on the phone and train more Turbo Tax employees. Lesson: Print your stuff, don't trust computer saving, and for heaven's sake, don't count on Turbo Tax keeping your data for you.



Also, this year, I had to work at finding where to put my dependent child. The question/community stuff is a pain, and rarely does a link to the right place appear. You still have to surf to find it, which I ultimately did. But this is a fail for me.



Otherwise, it's organized, and relatively clear. I just have a real dislike for the problems that I've been caused and their customer support. Dependent Info Hard to Find / Historical Data a Nightmare | 64001311|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1458

2 |  I have never had so many problems e-filing taxes. I have used TurboTax for years but this online service doesn't seem to make anything obvious. There seems to be no cross checking to make sure that the same information at different places. The state e-file was a complete mess. IL requires a PIN but you don't make it obvious where to enter it. I had to refile several times trying to get this sorted out and there was no obvious solution to it. It appears that you are using the Federal PIN rather than the state. I am still not sure that my taxes are going to be correctly filed.

The extra costs to file with TurboTax using a 1099 this year over previous years was outrageous and really hurt the bank. If costs don't go back down for someone like me I will not be using this service in the future The prices for filing with a 1099, deducting, and filing a state return were outrageously high | 64001270|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1463
1 | feel ripped off the program did not tell me as I moved from federal to state taxes that they were going to charge me. Then they claimed they would charge me $29.99 when I tried to file the state tax. Then, at the end, when I was filing both federal and state, they inexplicably charged me 64.99. I am completely upset. Turbotax is intentionally stealing from me and I will not use them again. 



I only wanted the free option and they misled me into eventually paying them 64.99 for what I could have done in an hour myself. Hate this experience. they made me feel like state taxes were free when they are not | 64001252|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1464

But what do I find when the website loads for me to pay. The charge will be $24.99. Even more!! WTF? I already paid for it once, then I have to give in and pay again.

So I stopped filing, ran to the bank and opened an IRA.

When the time came to enter the info. as a deduction it said YOU DON"T QUALIFY FOR THIS DEDUCTION due to MAGI over 70K. That info was on file already when the program recommended this step to me.

I tried to call, 45 min on hold and got disconnected. then I go to check out, and my $64.99 premier edition and free state is now $79.99 and $39.99. for 120.00 I could have had some one else have the stress of doing my taxes for me!!! just as expensive as the tax office, codes didn't work and no one available to help | 64001165|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1470
1 | Marginal I would be happy to pay for the turbo tax product before starting the return, then have the return loaded with the previous year's info, and then be able to complete the return and see the results on the actual 1040 and supporting schedules as I proceed. I would also like to be able to enter info on the return (in a what if manner) to see what the impact would have been had if other income or expenses were available. cannot see forms and return until the very end | 64001160|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1471
1 | Not happy Got to the end of my "free" return and wouldn't let me file unless I signed up for "deluxe Plan". Not only do I owe Uncle Sam this year, but I get held over a barrel (additional $55.00) by TurboTax. I've used them the last several years and have not had this problem before.....will have to think very carefully before using them again.....SHAME!!! hidden fees | 64001158|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1472

1 | Ugh, the IRS is brutal. I've filed with TurboTax for the only 3 years that I've been filing, and now I'm having problems with the IRS for past years with no help because I chose the affordable option. Seeming simple doesn't MAKE it simple, it just makes it even more confusing. | 64001138|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1475
1 | Not as expected :( Disappointed that "free" really means come on in and we will hammer you with additional services at added cost along the way. The amount of forms took longer than expected. The overall process was slower than I expected. Some things worked well, but others are clunky and repetitive. The worst part is that when you have a question, the FAQs can't answer it, and it takes FOREVER to get a hold of one of their agents on the phone. The other frustrating thing is that the "tax refund estimator" asks questions that should allow them to tell you a pretty accurate estimate of the refund - especially since I have no house, no kids, no wife and no additional earnings. But the estimator said I would get approx. $4300 back, while the real deal turbotax calculated less than half of that as the actual return. Really disappointed to find out my return was half as much as previously "estimated"! I assume "estimate" should mean within about 10% margin of error if all the input data was the same for both websites! Too slow, too many forms, added fees along the way | 64001134|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1476

1 | WORSE & LAST TURBOTAX EXPERIENCE After entering all W2's & many 1099's TurboTax crashed and lost everything. Had trouble logging back in for my previous year filing to help with this years' return. after 6 password reset attempts, 28 minutes on hold when told waiting time was 10 minutes I finally got back in.



Constantly asks to verify entries from previous year filing, including to look at lines on the form that it has loaded, instead of just asking if you amended your prior year filing without updating TurboTax.



Many questions were confusing. Have used TurboTax for about 18 years, will go to an accountant next year to save time and aggravation. Crashed and lost 90+% of initial entries, constantly asked for verification of info in the form eFiled in previous year. | 64001120|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1479

3 | Mostly good but problems came up Turbo Tax would not accept the Payer ID for a 1099-Misc for the State of Nevada. This was not some obscure small business, it was the Nevada government 9-digit code. This gave an error that would not go away, and prevented me from filing electronically. There was no address given by Turbo Tax for mailing a return to the IRS. I mistakenly mailed it to the address that prints at the beginning of the print file, for making quarterly payments to the IRS. These were useless, as I should get a refund. Why do they print out and why is there no information on what TT is printing? I later found out I should send my return to Fresno CA, not Cincinatti OH. I never had these problems in the past with TT. I'm dissatisfied with the 2015 product. Payer ID for 1099-MISC, no mail address for paper filing | 64001030|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1484

2 | Too Expensive for 1 extra addition I was unable to add in my HSA information unless i upgraded to the package costing $55. It was only one additional block of information that needed to be added and it didn't even earn me an extra amount on my refund to cover what the program cost. I should have been able to do this with the free version. I was basically forced to upgrade just to complete my return simply because I had an HSA.

3 | Like the CD Version Better If I needed to go back and fix something or needed help, most of the time, it would net let you amend certain parts before filing or the solutions were basically, "File and then amend when they reject."



I also thought that if the CD version gave you a free state filing, then the online version would too. Ended up costing me more than letting someone else do it. Not User Friendly, No Free State File | 64000975|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1492

2 | TurboTax Not what it used to be! I have been using TurboTax for YEARS, and I am an accounting professional & QuickBooks Pro Advisor. So I feel it is safe to say I am experiences and not a "newbie" when it comes to using this system. This year I had 4 calls into to support, one call lost when the support phone system crashed, and one call wasted when a rather unknowledgeable support person gave me a discount code for my troubles that I was not ever able to get to a screen to apply. I also had data that I put in that mysteriously disappeared, and found it tricky navigating the process without signing up for something I did not want . I do not expect these foils for a PAID tax filing service. If it was free, I could understand. Without knowledge of major improvements by tax time next year, I will be looking for different software. No longer intuitive/ repeated attempts to force an upgrade/support is ifffy | 64000924|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1495
1 | Frustrated First, I wanted a download to my computer - could not find the Web links.



I hate Web applications in a browser. I had a mistake but could not back up to fix it which forced filing by mail.



Could not find a way to review forms.



When I know what I want to do, why won't you let me do it? Not flexible | 64000919|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1496
3 | Generally great with some significant flaws Data entry process in general worked very well except where my documentation did not match what it wanted me to input. Significant difficulty with with ESOP. 1099 form from broker did not have blocks filled out in manner that Turbotax would accept. Help documentation was insufficient to determine correct way to enter information, so ultimately had to guess.



Final analysis process had similar problems as well as user interface issues. Turbotax would find an issue for review, but the information it would ask for was unclear, referencing the actual IRS form, rather than the simplified summary interface used for everything else. For instance, it would ask to correct an entry on item 3, without anything on the form identified by that number. The interface here was particularly bad. If you scrolled down to try and view the section it was referencing, the data fields and form in background would scroll at different rates, so you could not tell what the entries were referenced to. Ultimately had to again guess an entry that it would accept.



I have used it in the past when my taxes were simpler without any issue. As they have gotten more complex, have been required to use more premium versions, but you do not get any value for the additional price, Turbotax does not handle higher complexity very well. Final analysis review poorly done, not capable of managing information that does not fit it's framework | 64000914|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1497
1 | Outrageous I have been using TurboTax for years and it just keeps getting more expensive. The cost of the software, then an additional fee of $45 to do state and then a charge of $24.99!!!

2 | I have been using turbotax for years. Turbo tax sucked this year. No ability to talk to people. I tried to use the help, but never got response. Very disappointing. I 've been using TurboTax since 1996. And this is the first time I was not able to talk to a person. I am concerned about your customer service this year. I tried 3 times to contact help and all I could do was send a message to other users.

1 | Oklahoma Capital Gain/Loss Allocation The State of Oklahoma requires you to indicate whether or not the capital gain/loss was for an Oklahoma company. If you have a number of transactions (I had over 100), you are presented with a list and have to individually provide the Oklahoma city in which the corporation is located or check a box saying "not an Oklahoma based company". You have to go into each transaction and edit it. Once you edit a transaction, it takes you back to the top of the list and doesn't remove the one you just edited. You have to manually keep track of which transactions you have edited and it will not tell you which ones you haven't nor will it let you move forward unless you complete them all or skip it to come back later. It either needs to present you with a worksheet list that you can edit and see all edited transactions or simply remove each entry after it has been edited.

2 | Navigatigating through forms I have used turbo tax for years and currently prepare my 3 children's taxes as well. Obviously I like it. However, this year I had difficulty moving through the forms. Often if I hit the back button it would take me all the way back to the start of the topic instead of the previous question. Additionally it would skip several questions ahead when the continue button was pressed. This happened quite frequently. Software seemed slow & unresponsive, skipped ahead or too far back | 64000820|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1507
3 | Too redundant I do think TurboTax is the fastest/easiest, but the steps are too repetitive, especially considering there's a review step. Some information had to be entered three or more times. Other than that, fast and painless. Redundant to the point I wanted to quit life. Also, should not have to pay to import W2 info/preserve previous years' | 64000818|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1508
2 | eh... I seriously lost 75% of my refund due to the nickel-and-diming of your fees. Secondly...I didn't need to file a state return for Florida (nobody in Florida does) but that didnt stop you from trying to jack another $40 from me Expensive | 64000811|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1509
3 | e-Fileing State Returns By purchasing the TurboTax Premier CD, I thought I was purchasing the e-file option for both the Federal and State income taxes. I was surprised that I had to pay for the state e-file and that the price had gone up $5 from the package printing once I found the small print. I had to pay extra for the state e-file option on Premier Turbo Tax. | 64000780|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1510

1 | Poor Customer Service So for the fourth time, using this software, my Nebraska State return was rejected. Went through each time and corrected what it told me to, and each time it was rejected, despite having fixed all my errors. Called customer service and after being on hold for 45 minutes (Estimated wait time: 25) just to have them verify it before I submitted it again. When I finally got to talk to a person, she didn't know anything about taxes obviously, since she read the error back to me and said, well I don't know what that means, do you know what that error is? Well no, I don't that's why I'm calling you. She proceeded to ask dumb questions, like well do you live in Nebraska? No, I filed here and claimed residency for fun. I didn't get an answer from her on how to fix it, and hung up, when it became increasingly obvious that she had no idea how to fix it, or even what was wrong. Just hope that this one actually gets accepted, since I obviously won't get any support if it doesn't.

2 | Unhappy & Feeling Tricked and Manipulated! I first selected the File for FREE option because my income is so low and fixed, and it is really very simple as far as input info. This has always been my choice before and nothing has changed. But my first choice indicated I would be better off paying the discounted $29.95 for a simple return and get a little help from Turbo Tax to be sure I was getting "all I was entitled to get". I did not object to this really. HOWEVER, as I was entering, they ask a lot of questions that I answered, but they failed to tell me that they were leading me into the more expensive $49.95 deluxe package. It was NOT UNTIL AFTER I spent all afternoon entering the information they requested did they tell me I could not file until I accepted the deluxe priced option. Shame on you Turbo. These were discounted by 10% because of doing it through my credit union. I will let them know I am very unhappy Doesn't make it clear about your paying choices as you go. | 64000760|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1514
3 | What happened After I started my state return - NY - I was only shown an amount for a refund/payment and was unable to go through the state via the interview method - as had happened with the Federal form.



Although I could have done the state by editing the form directly at 6 PM on 4/18 I had neither the time nor the will to do so. I just sent the taxes in and will have to review and amend as needed.



I have used Turbo Tax for years and have never had this difficulty with the program.



One other things that occurred - in the Fed program I have entered various mutual fund sales - amounts and basis. The first time was told I made thousands of dollars - totally ignoring basis amounts. I deleted the figures and re-entered everything but this time the basis was taken into account- giving me the correct figures. I have no idea what happened to give me 2 wildly different figures. State was bad | 64000742|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1515
1 | Not Very Flexible My first year with a rental property and used TT thinking it would give me an advantage. I am not sure it did.



I also wasn't sure I was going to file my state return using TT, but it did not give me an option to not. In order to file my federal, I HAD to file my state with TT at an extra cost.



Next year I am going to use another service, I did not get the value for my money this year that is for sure. Too Restricted | 64000735|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1516

1 | Hidden fees I only used Turbo Tax because I'm lazy and ran out of time. I had a fairly simple return, and am a person who lives at poverty level. I had to pay $135 in fees just to file. Next year I won't use Turbo Tax. Too expensive | 64000664|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1519

2 | One Shining Star I followed all the Turbotax steps and it kept messing up my return. I called several times and no one knew what they were doing. Do your employees even know anything about taxes or just how to use your site?!?! Eventually, someone told me to file by mail (WRONG). Several months later, I am still worrying about my taxes and I call again because it's finally the deadline and I got nothing. I spent $100+ on your "deluxe" pack and am now realizing I didn't even need it. I wasted TWO HOURS and tried calling on two separate phone for Customer Support(not including the hours and hours I have previously wasted). FINALLY, I got a call back from Christine and she solves all my problems. Christine from Product Support is your only redemption after the heII I went through. I highly doubt you guys will read my whole review too. I also want to know if it is possible to get a refund if I didn't use or need "the deluxe" turbotax. Christine got me through but I am still wary of you guys. Probably not coming back unless I hear otherwise from you guys. Wasted a TON of time and money | 64000642|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1522
3 | Expensive !! I have been filing using TurboTax the past 4-5 years. First TD Ameritrade site claimed I will get $20 off by filing using TurboTax but I got only $15 credit on Federal part. In previous years State filing was very inexpensive, this time almost $40 !! I am considering saving that $40 next time by just using a EZ form.

I was surprised and dismayed that there was a $39.00 dollar charge to pay using my tax refund that doesn't appear until your ready to file. How about adding this to the ever increasing upfront fees. Also don't tell me it's free to use turbotax when it's not! Difficulty importing w2, charge to pay with tax refund. | 64000565|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1525

2 | Carryover problem - for 2 years (at least) the carryover from a NOL has caused problems completing a return and the TuTx tool does not allow you to clear input once you are "registered"

 - the subject carryover was due to a close/NOL of a business which no longer operates

 - in the "fix" Federal issues mode several screens pop up asking for business input about use of a vehicle and other assorted business expenses. It is NOT clear what to do with these screens (bypass? enter a "0" value?). The screens ask for yes/no, or data input. There is not an ignore option. 

 - when doing a final check I input "0" for the values of expenses and it completely changed the final tax due amount

 - I was UNABLE to reverse or clear this input....got a message

saying couldn't clear the return because it was already "registered". 

 - I was directed to completely start over. This is unacceptable. There should be no point in the filing process where a customer can't make corrections or edits. VERY FRUSTRATING. 2 YEARS a problem.

2 | still annoying Lost confidence in Turbotax since they have ignored my correspondence among others regarding a mistake in the Michigan Tax return that they have yet to correct after 3 years. The cost of the product has increased to a point where I will probably use another product in the future. getting too expensive for extra e-file and state return, Michigan TurboTax has had same mistake for the last 3 years - | 64000529|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1531

You people up top - I know you're working for the bottom dollar. But for the love of God, if you have any decency...be up-front about the likely total cost. It just comes accross as criminal to keep those numbers a secret until people have already invested a few hours.



Think about it. It's just sh1tty business. I won't be coming back, and I'll tell all my friends your policies are garbage.

1 | Overpriced, under supported How much it costs boils down to the free Ez or anything else. The extras are a waste of time, trying to get ahold of support takes 20-30min or more and even then they provided no help except to delete it and start over (which did nothing, but waste my time).



I will never use this service again, a physical tax service is cheaper, more reliable and immediate. Useless extras, extremely overpriced, lack of real support | 64000367|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1544
1 | Good Stuff I bought a Turbo tax Cd form Best Buy for $40.00 in the middle of my return, I had to upgrade the turbo tax to do my return. 

I had to pay the full price for the upgrade, after paying the full price for the CD at the store, it should be pro-rated 



At the end of the process you are asked to print the return twice, once before e-filing and once after e-filing. it is nerve raking because you don't know which print is the right print to have in your files. 



I LOVE TURBO TAX, I GAVE THIS A LOW RATING SO SOME ONE WILL READ THIS

1 | adding MAX Review and Quickbooks without asking I have been using Turbo Tax since 2007. I may never use it again as MAX Benefits for $59.99 was added without my permission. When I called my credit union the fraud department tech said that this is his third call in a row just from Turbo Tax alone. Also Turbo Tax adds in a $4.99 monthly charge of Quickbooks, you have no option but to pay for it and then cancel it as you must do because you can not file if you do not. I have already contacted my credit union, Consumer Affairs, next Better Business Bureau. fraudulently adding MAX Review and Quickbooks | 64000329|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1548

1 | Turbo Tax...way overrated I'm an Uber driver (for only one month in December). Because of that I needed to switch to the more expensive Business version of Turbo tax. It still was not clear why I needed to do this, making my tax return much more expensive. 



Also, an annoyance was that I was simply given the amount of taxes owed. I wasn't given any break down about why I owed this amount. Price went up dramatically because I'm an Uber driver, Needed to switch to a more expensive option | 64000281|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1552
1 | way over priced, will use and recommend taxact This is probably worth it for people with complicated returns, but for someone with easier returns I will recommend taxact.

2 | GOTTEN HARDER -log- in difficult... never recognizes the password, makes me do a new password over and over and over. 

-difficult to locate paperwork and when review, one has to go through every single window.

- liked it before... used to find forms in a filing cabinet and fill them out

- no clue as to why mistakes are mistakes when Turbo thinks i have a mistake. Need to go back to that other window, etc, find the error .. find the 'fix ' window. 

- might just have it done next year - i've used turbo tax since early 90s. HARD TO JUST FILL THE FORMS YOU WANT AND SEE WHAT THEY WILL LOOK LIKE FINISHED | 64000260|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1554
1 | unhappy with extra fees this will be my last year filing with turbo tax. I have a very simple returns and would do the free federal return (basic) and also my state tax which I would pay $29.99. however this year after finishing, I was prompted that I have to pay an additional $34.99 for processing, that's very dishonest of Turbo tax, all in all, instead of paying $29.99, I ended up paying a fee of $64.98. unacceptable, I could have went to h and r block and spend the $50 to have them prepare it. never will I use turbo tax services. they ripped me off it is not free as advertised | 64000240|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1555
2 | Overly "Helpful" I had trouble with the TurboTax sales tax calculations and discovered a defect in the system. I was forced to go the the official IRS forms and instructions anyway to be sure I was getting the appropriate tax deduction for Sales tax, so the $55 I paid was really just for e-filing, since I did all of my own calculations anyway. And despite submitting a help request for a call to discuss the bug, I never received a follow-up within the promised window. Instead, I had to delete all of my sales tax information and start over. Too much logic, no explanation of calculations, buggy, no support as promised | 64000218|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1556
3 | Won't talk to Mac? After several unsuccessful attempts to start my taxes on my purchased 2015 TurboTax Deluxe, I finally got through to a TurboTax service rep who was familiar with my problem - the Turbo Tax Deluxe 2015 could not be run on my Mac without complicated changes. The rep talked me through the changes and I was able to complete my taxes. It was obvious that many other customers had called in before I did. There is no excuse for this glitch - there are a lot of Mac user out there! 2015 TurboTax Deluxe WOULD NOT WORK on my Mac even though the package said it would! | 64000211|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1557

3 | Long Time User, Possibly Changing The advantage is, you can do your taxes from home. If you like to do things yourself, this is pretty straight forward and easy. I don't mind handling my own taxes with our modern tools.



Intuit has increasingly charged more for their service every year. No loyalty advantages for returning customers. Just more expensive each time. I was actually taken aback by this year's fees. Add to that, they prompt you to add on and upgrade at every turn now. I can't even count how many times i had to decline their desire to charge me more and more. It is becoming more expensive, and you are asked to upgrade for more money at every turn. | 64000151|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1561
3 | Great Program The reason for using this program was so I could e-file due to no printer, now how do I file. if the last date to file was today 4-18-2016, the E-File should be available, WHAT DO I DO NOW TO HAVE IT FILED IN TIME???????????

2 | VERY poor for someone working overseas I live and work overseas. Your pages are not designed for foreign addresses and phone numbers. In the end I could only file and pay using an American address, and that after hours of fighting your system. I was only able to file with assistance from your customer service by phone. I ended up filing without listing my foreign address because that is the only way I could pay. The IRS is going to wonder why I don't have a foreign address.

2 | No Amazon Giftcard Option My return has not changed significantly in the last 5 years. I always had the option to cash out some of my return via an Amazon gift card. This time, the option was not presented (and I bought TurboTax Home and Business from Amazon, actually!). All the reasons presented by a turbo tax representative to possibly explain this did not apply to me. Amazon gift card option did not show up this year | 64000070|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1565

2 | Why no discounts? VERY EXPENSIVE I've used Turbo Tax for about 15 years, always getting a 30-50% discount from one of the online brokerage accounts. NOT this year! I guess Intuit had to keep all the money for themselves to help pay for the expensive SuperBowl ads! It's unfortunate, so I'll be shopping around for another tax-prep package next year.

3 | not as easy or good as 3-5 years ago. The price seems to rise every year , regardless how much change in tax law. Far too much extraneous information in questions and trying to answer to many unusual or obscure tax situations. It also seems harder to move between sections to change or correct numbers or info points . I have used Turbo-tax since at least 2001 and have generally pleased . And my income has only changed when social security gives "cost of living " increase which is usually eaten by the increase in medicare payments. Please simplify rather than complicate "new and improved ", rarely is better . To increase and add unnecessarily to raise the price is no service at all. It is not an age issue due to severe medical issues I was retired a few years ago at age 38.Severe spinal problems, I still write and publish in the areas of economics, securities, and monetary policy. far to much extraneous asides , harder to move back and forth | 63999934|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1571

2 | Poor transition... I'm sure next year will now be fine that all my basic information is in their cloud, but my tax information up to TY 2014 was all TurboTax Desktop. It wouldn't load up past year's information properly. A pain!! It's great to have last year's info right there so you can follow things like depreciation and carried over items. We've had the same basic daycare setup for 5 years and I'd have been able to just update with this year's expenses if the continuity were there.



Now that I've gone to the online filing, I hope it'll be as easy next year as it has been in all prior years since I started using TT. The transition from PC program to online program was poorly done. Didn't import prior tax information correctly!! | 63999864|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1575
1 | Customer Service at the Bottom Level Poor customer service all around. App was really buggy, but Carolina and Supervisor Anthony fron Arizona told me: it's just the tablet you are using, since our family filled without any issue. Sorry guys, but I called about my problem, not to hear about how easy it was for the fam to file taxes. Lame, divisive, and rude. They both seemed amatuer, not able to listen to reason. I was told by them to use the desktop version, since the app wasn't working for me. This wasn't a real solution, and ultimately added to my frustration. Both seemed so uninterested, that I'm moving to another intermediary tax filling company. Asked to speak with a manager, but Anthony said the manager doesnt take calls, and it would be a while before i get a call back. How bout i say, See ya.

Well now I have to call quicbooks and get this removed, or they will charge me every month for the rest of my life. What a pain in the a**!!!!

Well the form is free, but electronic filing is an additional $25. They didn't tell us that. Extra states would be another $25 to prepare and another $25 each to file electronically. Kept offering upgrades.

3 | Not That Impressed..... So, I did turbotax to file because for the first time in years, I knew we would be getting a refund and we are required to itemize based upon our work. I had already done my taxes long form. The issue I have is the cookie cutter approach. For experienced users, this is probably not the way to go. Turbotax did not find anything for me that I hadn't already found for myself. Additionally, they want to add this, add that and everything has a fee attached. This is my first and last time using this software. It does not explain detailed itemized info and asks you to complete areas of forms not needed.

1 | OK, but a real foul up this time! TurboTax is normally great, but not this time. I entered $6500 worth of new windows in the 2015 Home Energy Credit section and somehow it doubled to $13,000. Then, when I realized that we had bought the windows in 2014 and tried to delete the purchase, TurboTax wouldn't let me. I called customer service and Mary got back to me within 20 minutes. She was nice, but we had to go through a lot of deletion trial and error to get it to zero. In the process, I lost the hour of data that I had already entered!

Perhaps I selected the wrong one but the system should be able to recognize it's a simple 1040 and charge accordingly. Through USAA (I'm a member), I used to pay only $19.99 and sometimes less.

3 | Better solution for Community Property Returns! The program itself is very easy to use; after all this is probably my 10th year using it. Bravo for that. However, its not nearly as useful for outlying situations. Specifically, the advice for handling excess 401K deferrals reporting is very confusing as your program has two contradictory solutions. Furthermore, it caused me to have to call several times, and I never got a good answer because most of those times my calls dropped after being on hold for at least 1.5 hrs. Also, it is a shame that this program can't handle domestic partner returns in California very well - after all it has been several years since the law required community property adjustments! Lack of clear direction and advice on thornier issues such as 401k deferrals and California community property returns | 63998665|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1644

This loop happened twice, but, all along, TT says "Don't worry, you'll have a chance to print or download your return after you file."

I transmitted my return -- but then I was shunted to a "Congratulations" page and a customer review form -- and the promised opportunity to view, print, and download a copy of my return was NEVER presented. 

This is a big, inexcusable FAIL. Assured I'd be able to print "later" -- never happened | 63998633|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1645

1 | After 15 years, giving up on TurboTax Business I've used TurboTax business for 15 years. I think it hit its peak about 5 years ago, when there was detailed and transparent mapping during import from QuickBooks Pro. Now once the import is done, I can't tell where the data went to verify everything was captured. Then I spend about 4 hours tracking down where Section 179 expense, officer medical, officer insurance etc went. Further, the import inexplicably ignores some mappings (e.g., Shareholder Disability Insurance, Employee Disability Insurance) and asks me to categorize them, WITHOUT even providing the account name so I know what account it is asking about. Since I can no longer rely on import, TurboTax no longer has any significant advantage for me, and the bugs in Section 179 reporting and opaqueness of M-1/M-2 reconciliation are beyond frustrating, so I'm going to try a different tax program next year. Import hides my data. M-1/M-2 reconciliation too hard. | 63997338|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1650

3 | Works well enough I've been using TurboTax Home & Business for several years and it seems to me that in the interest of making the program simpler and quicker to use, it has lost a level of detail that helps the user maximize tax deductions. I always go with the step-by-step UI so theoretically I should be accessing the highest level of program guidance but there are missing pieces. I think this is particularly true for employees who work almost exclusively from a home office and for other "gig" contractors.



For instance, I've had to call on my own knowledge and search efforts to track down how to deduct items like Medicare Advantage premiums and some home office expenses. mediocre search results and program help / directions | 63997036|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1655

3 | Pulling my hair As a member of the clergy, I find the IRS rules and the filling in of Turbo Tax info to be very confusing and difficult to navigate. Since I end up paying self-employment tax, there is little support info or clarification about what to put into TT regarding deductions for self-employment, how to treat housing allowance versus actual expenses, etc. My pay and expenses are pretty much the same from year to year, and I got a small refund in 2014, but had to pay taxes in 2015 when I was expecting a larger refund. What changed? I have no way of knowing if I filled out the blanks differently, or if the calculations changed due to a tax increase or rules change. Don't know what changed since previous year. Unclear what to put in some boxes. Clergy filings are really difficult. | 63996902|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1657
3 | Lots of upsell Right at the beginning, it deleted all my information from last year when I declined to pay $30 to file.



The software tried to re-add the $30 fee at least 10 more times throughout the filing process.



The $30 state fee isn't mentioned until state information is completed. If you decline, they delete the tax return.



After wading through the advertisements, I was ready to file. TurboTax then promoted a prepaid visa gift card for my return. These cards are predatory to low income individuals. Not a fan.



Next year, I plan to use alternative tax filing software. Obstructive advertising, Information deletion, Prepaid Card gimmick | 63996896|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1658

Taxes no lower than doing it on my own | 63996387|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1666

3 | Would like a Replay button The one feature that has been needed for many years is the ability to repeat a step-by-step section without needing to re-answer various questions. It would be nice if there was a new navigation button that made it clear that the user wanted to replay the step(s) without changing anything, or have to remember whether they previously answered "Yes/No" to questions.



For the purposes of reviewing previous data, once a section has been completed and the user revisited that section, add a "Replay" (or "Browse") button to the choices. The user can quickly skip past the screens as needed, but be able to retrace their steps. When revisiting some areas, previous check boxes or questions are not defaulted to the response previously given. | 63996363|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1668
1 | No help when I really needed it! I've used TurboTax for years. This is the first year I've had no luck getting a representative to help. I was disconnected twice after holding an hour each time. Overnight, I finally hung up because I had to get up for work the next morning. I really, really needed help and they failed me this year. Will seriously rethink using TurboTax again. Getting help is impossible!!! | 63996359|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1669
2 | Outrageous Refund Processing Fee only at the END! I have been using TurboTax for years and I do not EVER remember having paid a refund processing fee of $35.00!



Since I have previously trusted TurboTax to only assess reasonable fees, I did not attempt to complete my Federal and State returns until ALL information was available and double checked. The Refund Processing fee was not disclosed until the final submission was to be made!



As an Expert Witness on "Deceptive Fees" before the Federal Trade Commission(FTC), I intend to report this clearly Deceptive practice to the FTC! Outrageous Refund Processing Fee only at the END! | 63996357|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1670
2 | OK but not Thanks turbotax for the dozen or so years but it is time to move on. Really after all those filings no that Im paying taxes I have to pay 2.49% to a kickback unnamed 3rd party pretty cheesy and greedy. I dont feel the Bern but I am tired of hidden and sneaky costs thrown in at the end you should be ashamed.. After my tax bill last year it would have been nice to get some straight forward withholding advice for this year not just a sales pitch for investing

looking for somebody new so that I am not trapped into filing this way again. Thanks for the soapbox too many charges at the end, no loyalty dividends | 63996340|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1671
1 | Not a gold standard _ Disappointing Have to google first to find out how to use TurboTax effectively. TurboTax has to hire local brains or train the stupid Indian contractors to get its software straight. Hopelessly not intuitive _ will TurboTax accept liability for wrong calculations? | 63996311|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1672

2 | Too Many Ads TurboTax files me taxes for me and calculates everything. However, it doesn't explain why you got what you got (unless you purchase an upgrade so they can explain basic information to you that is available online). After you choose the free option, TurboTax will pester you multiple times whether or not you want to upgrade. It will make you say "No Thanks" three times in a row before moving on. It also makes you pay to file your state taxes... with my return only being $15, there was no reason to pay $30 for them to do it for me. Lots of ads, Not free for state | 63996200|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1674
3 | Disappointed by the pushy sale stuff Hey, I used the free version for my son after I paid for TurboTax Premier to file my own taxes. It is not free if you try to upsell/trick users into paying more. He is getting back $101, so it is annoying to have to work out of all the tricks. All that stuff takes away from a really class product. I am not sure I will be using TurboTax next year, precisely because of all the extracurricular stuff. The pushy sale of Turbo services is annoying | 63996199|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1675
2 | battle over who gets my money - IRS vs TurboTax Although TurboTax has made it easy for me to do my taxes for the past 3 years, it has become an increasingly more expensive and dishonest platform. The option to add on features for an additional cost keep showing up even after saying "no thanks" the first time. For example, taking the cost of TurboTax out of my federal return. I said "no thanks" the first time and then I almost paid for it due to a roundabout way of saying the same thing. Due to increased cost of TurboTax and it's continued dishonesty over the years, I will most likely choose H&R Block next year. dishonest in costs | 63996191|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1676
1 | Too many glitches Waited 45 minutes for phone help. The person couldn't help me. Sent me to an expert - supposedly 15 minutes. I was on the phone 1-1/2 hours and finally hung up.

I've been using TurboTax for several years and this will be my last year. Glitches turned a 30 minute return into a 3 hour nightmare | 63996189|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1677
1 | NO REFUND WE HAD NO REFUND, NOT THAT WE EXPECTED ONE. TURBO TAX KEPT SAYING "BLAH BLAH ABOUT OUR REFUND WHEN WE OWED!!! IS THE COMPUTER THAT DUMB? PLUS WE ALREADY OWE A GREAT SUM AND THEN THEY CHARGE US $94.98??? YOUR COMMERCIALS INDICATE FREE! I DONT THINK WE PAID THAT MUCH LAST YEAR. 

IF WE HAVE TO PAY THAT MUCH, WHY DONT WE GO TO A LIVE PERSON? 

WE WILL NEXT YEAR. IM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!  | 63996184|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1678
2 | hidden fees started out with a forty dollar tax return but with all the fees it turned into a hundred dollar tax return and that was without the representation. Next year I will take it back to the tax service to have it done their hundred dollars includes everything.  | 63996164|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1679
3 | Cannot edit state taxes On the Idaho return, going back to edit any number requires going through all the questions over again the same as if you are starting the return from scratch. This is poor design; you should be able to go back and edit any value like you can for federal. Cannot edit state taxes | 63996141|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1680
2 | somewhat deceptive Purchased Home & Business at Costo. Federal e file. state returns. Thought state was included, but not. Get all the way through and find out it will cost me ANOTHER $25 to file state (even though you can file state FREE at state site)...and small print on back says $19.99 and was charged $24.99. WHY? i thought i had purchased program and still had to pay | 63996056|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1681
3 | Good for federal, not as good for state The preparation of the federal tax return went well overall. I have been using H&R Block's tax TaxCut Deluxe software for the previous four years, but the interview process for TurboTax Deluxe was better.



On the downside, the software would have made me miss out on about a $500 state deduction if I had not realized that something was amiss, bypassed the interview process to go to the forms, and have fixed the problem there. That wasn't easy to do either because one form with that figure wouldn't permit me to change it so I had to look for another form where I could make the necessary changes. The specific problem I experienced related to TurboTax not using information from my W-2 about contributions to my state retirement plan. ...but preparing the state return not as well. | 63996041|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1682
3 | Watch out! Misleading deductions. I've used TT for years. However as the laws change, TT gets better at leading you astray when it comes to deductions.

1 | price hike was way to much the price seemed to double from last year and everything talks about your refund well if you owe that is a large slap in the face. will not be using this sight again unless the price goes down. expensive | 63995968|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1686
3 | I used to like TurboTax I have always been a big fan of TurboTax in the past and found it to be the most painless way to do my taxes, but this year, it seems as though the interface was actually less helpful. It was not possible or easy to undo an action once you have submitted something - for instance - a telephone number was missing - you get to the end of the process and it doesn't just have you enter your telephone number, you are forced to recycle through the entire process from page one. Not the best UX design. I would expect better. Redundant and Tedious | 63995957|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1687

2 | Fees are a bummer I filed taxes for my daughter - who is 19 and a full-time student no problems, no fees. Just finished filing the same way for my 22 year old son, also a student, when I got to the State portion they charged me $29.99 plus tax to file for him. His state refund was only $39.00, so basically they kept his entire return, totally bogus. Next year I will just have my accountant do his for him. They add it to mine for free.

1 | Surprise cost of deluxe I will never use this service again. Didn't like the $54.99 on one page and then when I agreed to upgrade there was a $39 additional changre for state. Real | 63995854|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1691
3 |  This year's was just okay. I was able to navigate last year's product better and easier. I never did find a place to be able to print specific pages for my own file. The part for recalculating the AGI for Minnesota was very confusing. I just had to leave it alone and hope it was correct or that the state would make any corrections for me. You basically have improved the product each year that I have used it (2005 - 2014) except maybe for 2015. In some areas a step back. I liked last year's program better. I never did find a place to be able to print only specific pages of the tax form | 63995848|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1692
1 | Snakes When i started my review, i picked free. By the time i finished, i had no choice but to pay for deluxe. This is really pathetic because there was no warnings or anything until i finished there would be a 55 fee. I wont be coming back to turbotax because of this and im going to make sure i get the word out to everyone i know that turbotax is a bunch of snakes. If you were a decent company at all you would fix this, but im not holding my breath.

2 | HAD to pay Have to fix the software so that if you make a change or designation and want to go back and delete it that it can be easily deleted. Instead have to switch back and forth between forms and step by step and too time consuming.

And I am closing my USAA account just because I was frauded by them to use you. You claimed a fee of $44.99. But at the end everything turned into $119.99 or something like that. Unbelievable. You are not all that!! 



You got me this one time. But you won't get me again. And I will tell everyone about this too!! Most importantly I will blast you on social media! Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat........ All your hidden fee's at the end!! | 63995707|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1698

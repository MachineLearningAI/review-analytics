3 | Extra costs The box isn't clear when it describes what's included in a package. I didn't like their offering "add ons" while I was completing my return. I had to upgrade which cost much more than if I had purchased that set to start with. Then by the time I paid for e-filing the state return, I could have hired someone to do the taxes for me for less.

2 | Used to be good Had to go back through parts of federal (continue, continue, continue, continue, continue) and ALL of state, TWICE (continue...) to get TT 2014 to accept my return for submission. The "errors" it was looping on were "missing data" in fields that were supposed to be ZEROS. Even the online help indicated that others had the same struggle, but the "reply" from TT was useless. Errors put me in loop, but it wasn't MY error - it was TurboTax! | 45454051|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1
2 | What a grind! Investment income. Stock sale. You do not have a catagory for long term sale of asset with no cost available. Item box x on 1099 Div says should be moved to box E. IRS says move to box E. TT says there is an error that entry MUST have a cost. Since cost not available, and if put in Box, it would be taxed as a short term gain, your programmers have made an error. Spent off and on over an hour with your tech support.

Your final final review says all fixed, you can file it, but when I go to print it it says I STILL have errors!!! Too many ads.

You have removed option to opt out of upgrading by making certain forms very difficult to find. YOU MUST leave me an option to NOT UPGRADE. I used to be able to do ALL forms with the basic version. Sorry I got the homeowners deluxe version. IF I have to do have of the form in form view, why should I buy it at all?

Car page. I did NOT enter any expenses for an auto this year, but had to go thru the nonsense of filling out the form. Why not a box to check that says "No car expenses this year?" And then not have to fill in forms that will be blank.

Called phone number on website for Turbo Tax and got the voice mail of a person out on maternity leave. No other option. Had to search entire site to get ahold of cust service. I est. it took me nearly 15 minutes to locate a phone number that worked.

I have been using TT since 1990. You change the order of questions too often. Why not have a check list of the questions that you will ask so we can fill in the answers BEFORE we start the actual return..Ties up the computer and takes hours to complete a return.

Why is it a BIG DEAL to choose a nickname?? So what if there are more than one John Does? You honestly think I'm going to give you something I don't like just to satisfy your computer???

1 | Poor service 2014 This is the first year that I would say I would not use Turbo Tax again. Why pay for automative services when you can not e-file! I has been a waste of $188.45. Lack of service | 45451898|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|3
3 | Great Federal. Disliked State Overall the Federal filing was very straight forward for filing jointly. My problem came from my wife and I working in separate states and the requirement to file separately. The process is complex to perform and the secondary tax payer cannot efile and has to mail their forms in stating security as the reason. I ultimately had to create 3 turbotax files to complete. It would seem that you should be able to be able to do it all within one file. using separate files made it very challenging when looking at which items are separated so you are not double taxed. I will probably have to have my state returns reviewed/amended by a professional. poorly done for people filing in multiple states | 45451623|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|4
2 | Too Many Bugs I itemize. In the Other Deductions & Credits category, $15k of "Other Deductions" was automatically being entered from nowhere. After paying and downloading for 2014 Premier I still had the problem. My son's Federal return has now been rejected twice for the wrong ePIN, and now the tax filing is late!

I follow the instructions and hit a dead end for filing the amended form. I never could print any copies other than electronic ones. This messed me up with my state form and they are now on my case to file. I have used Turbo Tax for years....NEVER AGAIN The 2015 version is a nigtmare | 45445146|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|8

Now I have to pay penalties and late charges to the IRS because of Turbotax's failure to submit. I will never use this program again. In the end, I was charged another 1,000 on top of the 2137.00 I already owe to the IRS for a mistake that I was not at fault for. Program malfunction | 45435209|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|9

2 | Was great ... last year I needed to fix my return. In the past, whenever this happened TurboTax took to right to the place I needed to go. This time it simply told me to open my form 8965 and fix it. I could not find any way to open this form.
So I went to customer support. They said they would call me back in 60 minutes. It said to call back if no one calls in 60 minutes. The page also included a number to call. It was not clear that I was suppose to call first to get in the queue, so I wasted 90 minutes waiting for a call which was never coming.
After I called back and got in the queue, I waited for another 150% of the quoted wait time. Still no call back. I called again and got put back in the queue again. Shortly there after, I got a call back, the agent didn't know how to open the form, only how to delete it.
After finally getting everything fixed, I got another call back (from the final time I had called them). They didn't know they had already talked to me. Their new customer service system is worse that the Obama Care web page for all the problems it has. I'll give them another chance next year to see if they can get back to their old glory, otherwise, I'll be looking for new tax software. ...

1 | Bad Changes you have changed your product for the worst. it is unclear at points within the software, and not set up the same way in its installation - ie: one cannot open the program from the short cut and reach the file in progress. there are other awkward transitions and cloudy issues and directions. I have been a Turbo Tax user for about 10 years, and this will be my last. you have taken a good product and made it bad. even your insistence on using a "nick" name on this review is stupid.

1 | Could not enter Wis non-res tax withheld Until this year I was a delighted TurboTax user. This year, I did not like the new format and would suggest offering former users the option of sticking with the old format - at least during a transition year. The new format on Premier was not transparent - I could not go to forms when needed to check specific items.Worst of all, despite hours of effort using desktop TurboTax Premier version ($85), I Could not enter Wis non-res tax withheld. After more than 6 hours of trying on my own and then a cordial 45 min phone discussion with your TurboTax on expert, the issue still went unresolved. This caused me to have to file for an extension for all of my taxes - not ideal, to say the least. Your person said he rebatted my $85 and told me to get TurboTax Delux were I could see the forms. So I then had to buy TurboTax Delux - at least that offered the forms option - where, by myself, I figured out how to sidestep Turbotax automated system (by going directly to the forms and searching out the place for withholding - not at all evident - another 30 mins wasted) to finally get credit for my Wis non res tax withheld on my Wis tax form. Next year, if I don't switch to another brand, I will buy TurboTaxDelux I guess because of the bug in TT Premier. I don't understand this oversight by TurboTax. It cost me hours and hours of wasted, frustrating time. Not a happy camper here at all. I finally did get my taxes in.

2 |  I have used Turbo Tax for about 15+ years while completing taxes for my family and friends. This year was very frustrating. I was unable to download my free state or purchase an additional state. I was also unable to e-file any returns. I spent over three hours on the phone with your techs to download the free state, purchase the additional state and to e-file one return.

Your techs were very patient, professional and knowledgeable.

However, I will not be using your product next year.

2 | This program has gone down hill I have been a loyal user of Turbo Tax since it was a DOS based program. Well I think NO MORE!!!.

It used to be Deluxe did everything.
Then I had to upgrade to Premier because I sold stocks.
Now I have to upgrade to home and business to do a very simple schedule C.
Price goes up and functionality goes down.

Now I could live with some of this. But now all the help does is take you to the user forums - no real help available.
The functionality for dealing with K-1s is broken especially when a disposition is involved.
It is harder and harder to find where data comes from and how it is populated.

I will be trying one of the other programs next year. Increase in cost, requiring higher versions for basic stuff, NO HELP worth using | 45425637|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|22

3 | Glad you came to your senses The initial release of TurboTax Deluxe did not include, as it has in all the previous years I used TurboTax, the section for figuring interest, dividends and I believe Schedule B, leaving me perplexed and frustrated with the obvious manipulation to "get more money."

Fortunately, that was changed before I totally switched away from TurboTax. I felt that was very underhanded and "money driven," just trying to get us to pay more for less service.

Other than that, the program works quite well. Thank you. Sometimes does not fully explain problems when smart check shows an area to be fixed | 45424092|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|25

1 |  Apparently, our return that was finished on Turbo Tax on April 13 was never actually e-filed. This is just one-more instance where we found the Turbo-Tax process to be much too complicated.

Another example that I just encountered: trying to get an acceptable nickname! Too, Too compluicated | 45413563|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|28
3 | Annoyed about e-File I find it annoying that some of the labeling is misleading. In the VA state return one of the deduction items lists "VA Prepaid College Tuition Plan". But you have to click into the category to find out that this is ALSO where REGULAR 529 payments are put, which have NOTHING to do with prepaid tuition plans. Irritating. This kind of thing happened a few times in the Fed return as well. Why would I want to go down the "Prepaid" path if I do not have a "prepaid" plan? Well, turns out I freakin' had to. Why not just say ALL 529 plans??? That IS what it was, after all.

Next, for the IRAs, why not ask me if I want TT to solve for the max IRA I can have, then let me tweak it? Instead I have to tell it how much I theoretically put in, and then jump through all of the freakin' hoops to then find out I don't qualify for that much, or that I cannot do a Roth, or only part can go into a Roth. C'mon Intuit, you can't ask if I have a Roth and a traditional IRA, then solve for me how much I can set aside, THEN ask the amount? You cannot do that right there in the Q&A as I waltz through the program?? Hire better programmers.

Next, I am especially ticked off that I cannot e-file my state return after I have e-filed my Fed return. In VA, the state return is not due until May 1, and the day I did my Fed return I did not feel like slogging through the state as well. I did not see ANYWHERE a warning that I would not be able to e-file the state return later. This TORQUES ME OFF! In 2015 I can dump my tax returns up to your cloud, but Turbo Tax isn't smart enough to keep track of the fact that I already e-filed the Fed return???? Why??? Gimme a break, you guys! I'm a long time TT user, but this could push me to Klipinger or the like. And I pay for the Home and Business edition, which costs me a hundred bucks each year. For that I cannot at least have the option to e-file my state taxes LATER, WHEN THEY ARE ACTUALLY DUE??!!! Very annoying.

Gotta say this may have been the worst experience I have had with TT, and I have been using it for more than a decade. Too many misleading labels; cannot e-file state return if Fed return already e-filed | 45411552|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|29

2 | Good Concept This was my first time using it. When submitting and paying by Visa, it looked like it was filed and I was finished. I became concerned when I checked on why my state tax was not deducted and found out my return was NOT submitted before the April 15 deadline.
Why is there not an email sent out alerting me? Now I will have to pay penalties even though I filed a week Before the deadline.

1 | turbotax handling of nonresident state is horrible Did my federal + NJ with no issues, then got a K-1 from an estate and had to do a non-resident form for NY, and that was a disaster from the start. It did not correctly transfer in simple stuff like the taxpayer info and the tax year from the federal form into the NY taxpayer info form.
So then it was asking questions like "did blank have any income in tax year blank"; was especially bad if you had to pick who something belonged to and both choices for names were blank.
So I switch to forms, and it says there are errors with the NY taxpayer info form so I fill it in manually; that gets rid of the error, but really doesn't seem to fix the issues.
But I make it thru everything, all the error checking and audits, and go to file, pay for filing and get to the absolute last step of clicking on the button to transmit the returns
AND THEN it complains you can't fill in the info in the NY taxpayer info form, it has to be imported.
SO WHY DOES IT WAIT UNTIL THEN TO CHECK THAT???
So I go back and remove the info I filled in,
and then it complains that it is missing again.
So I go back to federal and walk thru everything again,
go back to NJ and walk thru everything again,
go back to NY and walk thru everything again;
Luckily going thru everything a second time seems to have
made it import the Federal taxpayer info into NY,
and now I can file.

I'm seriously going to look at other tax programs next year.
Especially after having to pay $39.95 for a second state!

1 | turbo tax Support is the worst. advertises being able to contact customer service, but even with the software they make it almost impossible to find a phone number and will always redirect to web page with input only from customers (and not usually applicable to your situation). software has not transfered from previous years (for the past 5 years) as they advertise (and of course you can't get customer service). they are always trying to upsell more services to maximize their $ and delete parts of the software to force you to buy more expensive versions. have been using turbo tax for 15 years and almost every year finish with a bad taste about it. since it doesn't transfer anyway and with no customer service, next year for sure i will try a different software. It's just how they treat loyal customers. does not transfere from past years(5), will always try to upsell. | 45350195|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|40

3 | Disappointed for the first time! For the first time -- after using TT for more than a decade -- I had significant concerns with the product.

1) I was almost done with everything (using TT Deluxe as always) when I tried to enter my K-1 information and was forced to pay $24.99 to upgrade to Premier. As a regular, long-term customer, you should have had some way to lest me know about this product change other than a last-minute surprise.

2) On top of that, I am still unable to e-file my state return because of a software bug that was reported online more than 2 months ago and still has not been fixed. I spent 1 hour on the phone yesterday, both on hold and speaking with some. Yet, have not yet solved the problem. I'm about to try again.

Still think its the best of its kind, but hate to see TT go downhill like this. Surprise charges and software bugs | 45345311|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|45
2 | Overseas residents The online service works well until, as an American living abroad, one has to enter overseas addresses.

1 | Please, I just want answers. I already filed my return 3/30/15, i have a COPY in my records from Turbo Tax, I was wondering why i had yet to receive my return; I called the IRS, they could not give me information & suggested i contact you, i went ahead and signed on my turbo tax account after finding no number to call/contact, IT SAID MY RETURN WAS STILL IN PROGRESS?? I don't believe this is an inappropriate attitude. I want answers, why did turbo tax state i was complete/done, then stated i was not complete/done? Now my return has been sent extremely late. Now I'm not in compliance with the IRS.
Also, why has TT not worked on merging 2 emails? I'm sure you can merge emails with a couple security questions--you already have security features and all of our sensitive data. Overall, turbo tax made my years tax return a nightmare, and i don't even have a complicated return! I have never filed a late return and am so embarrassed and concerned with this status.
Please fix these issues. Please don't make anyone go through this nonsense, I have a copy from Turbo Tax stating my return was e-filed 3/30/15! How is that possible i had to do this again 4/28/15? Please let me know there's an actual human being somewhere out there reading this. I just wanted to talk to a human, not to yell at them, but to genuinely answer my questions.

Im at work, but If i could, I would upload a picture of the dated document from Turbo Tax (TT) i printed with the 3/30/15 date stating i was complete and my return was e-filed. absolutely no humans to talk to, cannot merge emails, false information of tax return provided to me the user, etc. | 45340609|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|47
1 | Extort Money Charge me 39.99 to down load the state then charge another 29.99 to file the state.

The cost to file Indiana was more was more than the cost of the original software

Once the return is done of cause you are going to pay to file it.

I will just have to use taxact or OLT next year and make sure I tell everyone else to use them instead of turbo tax that lures you in with low price

2 | Revisiting a rejected state return The process to fix a rejected pin/AIG is too cryptic.

The question regarding school expenses was too easy to miss. I did have "a student"...I had four students totally more that $850. Software should point more directly.

3 | I payed for the program then had to pay more I paid $60 plus tax for the Deductions and & Homeowners Deluxe edition then have to pay $43 for an additional state then on top of that $24.99 for each state efiled as well as $34.99. You've got to be kidding me!!! Not to mention the fact that I already paid once for an additional state: Order number: TTDW16985903662
Order date: Apr 14, 2015
Total charges: $42.69 and had logged into my existing account to do so the 1st time but was unable to complete due to errors that needed to be reviewed, which took some time due to my schedule. That's ridiculous!!! Why didn't your program recognize my initial payment for the form!!!??? I expect a refund for one of the amounts of $42.69 the additional fees outside of the cost of the program | 45337342|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|52
3 | Not the best TT year, but still ok Had to override too often to fix problems with multipile stock sales purchased at different times. Transfers to multiple lots worksheets Parts II, III and IV was inconsistent and sometimes just wrong.

Also, tough to handle when the number of shares got too big and finally figured out that I had to divide by 1,000 and muliply the price 1,000. No room to tell IRS about that, so had to wing it. Also, could you please give an efile option to send some of the worksheets and calculations to the IRS to help explain to them?

I have used TT successfully for many years and really feel it is valuable, but when it gets a little complicated, then users must be wary and extra careful.

Thanks a lot, TT made several errors in transferring to multiple lots worksheet and on to Sch. D. Poor execution when no 1099-B's. | 45337203|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|53
1 | TurboTax used to be better... this will be the last time I e-file with Turbotax.
It's now just as expensive as going to a tax professional's office & having them fill out the forms.
$94 for a Federal & State 1040EZ is pretty ridiculous. H&R Block is now cheaper...

1 | It works, but they use sneaky tactics for your $. Turbo tax works well. The system they use is pretty much flawless, BUT... there are frequent interruptions where they suggest that you upgrade to their "PLUS" package. I'd go as far as saying that they trick you into buying their services. I used the FREE edition package, and more than twice they suggested that I use the PLUS edition, all times I declined the offer. I'm not a business owner, I get no special tax-deductions; I have the most basic tax returns on the planet... comparatively.

By the time I was checking out, I owed nearly $60.00. So much for free. It took me about 15 minutes to figure out that because I chose to pay for my $29.99 State returns with my federal refund, they tacked on an additional $29.99. Not once did they warn me of this, I had to do in depth research and site-browsing. Beware. Sneaky Upgrading Tactics, Too many interruptions | 45325445|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|58

2 | Problematic Besides the obvious major problem of Deluxe not having the correct forms to do my taxes as in the past many years, it hit me with some choices in the walk through that were misleading and repetitive of earlier inputs. That threw me for a loop and the choice I made was extremely costly. The one click erases my reported incomes of certain 1099's and proved so excruciatingly impossible to correct that I just abandoned that attempt and named it "Abandoned attempt" so I wouldn't go back into it. It took me only 1 1/2 hours the second time compared to 2 1/2 hours the first time because it was difficult to figure out the first time what it was really asking for me to enter. I have a self-employed business, a rental farm, some royalties, and retirement income. Deluxe would not handle that and I had to spent the full amount to buy the small business TurboTax. Wasted my money!!! They planned it that way and no amount of apology can make up for the deceit and intentional misrepresentation that they promoted. I do not recommend TurboTax because they are a greedy company who want more money and didn't care for their repeat clientele. The others are cheaper and use TurboTax information from a previous tax return as well. Perhaps the others will increase their share by TurboTax's blatant disregard to their customers. I honestly don't know when I have been so let down and angered by a company!

I opened up Turbo Tax and it says my taxes forms were rejected. It sure would have been nice to know that. Now I'm guessing I will incur taxes and penalties.

2 | Frustrated I found the need to upgrade to more expensive editions of TurboTax both frustrating and irritating. My tax situation was no different this year than last.

2 | Have to think about using Turbo Tax again The biggest peeve is that I thought I had e-filed my federal taxes on 4/13 but Turbo Tax did not complete the transaction because it was waiting for me to complete the state also -even thought the state was not due until 5/1. If i get penalized for not filing on time, I will charge Intuit any fees. There was no warning that this was happening, the software gave me the impression that the transaction had completed. What moron would have coded the software in this manner??

3 | turbotax filing 2014 I do appreciate the ability of Turbo tax to get a great refund. This year, Turbo tax kept increasing the amount they were charging me when I make so little and my understanding is that anyone making 60,000 or less can have a free return. I usually start at irs.gov, though not this year. I am frustrated about the cost and the last company who charged me a large amount with my low income, I have not returned to in several years. I will have to do more research for 2015 to determine who is the highest rated for the free refund. If it's turbo tax, oh well, I'll be back.

3 | Double charged! I really do like using Turbo Tax. However, the software package that I bought provided me with one FREE State e-filing. When I got to the end and ready to submit it charged me. Then when I became so frustrated and just succumbed to the fact I was going to have to pay or risk losing what I did (I was just personally afraid of that) I chose the option to charge my debit and it wouldn't even begin to link me to that option and instead charged an additional amount because i had to choose the option to hold from tax refund. So there goes 50$ dollars and I already paid 50$ plus for the CD. Not happy. Only complaint I have EVER had with Turbo Tax!

3 | Some not good "improvements" It is good software for getting return completed, but for some reason there were many instances where I was not certain it transferred data from my 2013 return. This made it confusing at times. Then the whole debacle of moving simple Schedule C activity to another higher priced software was annoying, as is the high cost of additional state software ($49.99 same as basic Deluxe package with 1 state, and the high price for filing state returns ($24.99 ea). Might as well hire someone to do it all for me. May not use in future. Data transfer from 2013; Sch.C debacle; high cost of additional state and cost of state filing (2 x $24.99) | 45283304|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|80
2 | Great with Feds, but issues with state Using TurboTax Premier for a number of years and have to admit that entering updated data was the easiest and fastest ever. The problem came when e-filing. We've done this for a number of years as well, but this year it was screwy from the start. Paid for the Iowa state return to be e-filed, as we have done in previous years, hit the button to e-file... The Feds acknowledge receiving, but Iowa says it has not been transmitted, yet. Problem with going back and retransmitting Iowa is you can't. Both Fed and State have to be filed together. So, in the e-file section it says my state return hasn't been transmitted, but in the printing section it says it has and not to send a paper return. The customer service section was a labyrinth of frustration/futility. While I've been a satisfied customer for years, my calm is being tested.

So, now as state filing deadlines approach I'm having to contact the state department of revenue as to whether they received the e-filed tax forms or not, send paper forms, or file an extension. State taxes - not so smooth with e-filing | 45281932|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|81
3 | Good overall; Iowa and Foreign Income, not so much I have income from outside the USA. TT makes it incredibly clunky and confusing to enter this information, expenses, deductions, taxes paid, etc. The step-by-step breaks down and the prompts for what to enter (or not!) are woefully incomplete. For example, I had carry-over Foreign Tax Paid from previous years that TT clearly recognized...but I had to re-enter anyway! That involved digging out old forms, etc. I should not have to do that! I also had to twice-enter other info about my foreign income, deductions, etc. I remain very uncertain as to whether this was all done appropriately. Not good, TT -- and it is fix-able, if you care enough to do so. You need to clean this up, please.
ALSO: I file a return in two states. Michigan state stuff seemed okay; Iowa, on the other hand, had a few deficient areas (especially regarding my having to exit the program to look stuff up!) I know Iowa is a relatively small state, etc. -- but an upgrade is in order, TT. Please care enough to do so.
Finally: It is good that you claim that you are fixing the "You file Schedule C so now you have to buy a more expensive TT product" debacle in future years; okay. But SHAME on you for being so arrogant, dismissive of your clientele, and flat-out nakedly greedy in the first place. The only reason you're un-doing it is because you were massively called on it -- this is another log on that substantial woodpile. Shame on you for being so greedy.
Bottom-line: Due to the aforementioned deficiencies, deferred maintenance of your software, and stunning greed and arrogance -- after lots of years of using TurboTaz I WILL BE CONSIDERING USING OTHER TAX PREP SOFTWARE NEXT YEAR with a serious eye toward adoption and change.

3 | Review I have used Intuit Pro Series in the past as well as Turbo Tax. I was very disappointed in the pricing change for Turbo Tax this year. I feel like Turbo Tax was trying to pull the wool over the heads of its customers.

1 | Intuit Has a Problem The fiasco over the state return is deeply offensive. As an ex-CEO of a NYSE listed firm, I would drop Intuit if possible.
You need to be open and explicit as to what your product will and will not accomplish, and exactly what the costs of alternatives are. I've been a satisfied TurboTax user for many years, but this year's experience was outrageous.

3 | Fees for everything--Outrageous! The program is affordable and reasonable, but the add-on fees seemed endless. I purchased the Deluxe version. In the end, the cost to complete my taxes and file totaled in excess of $200.

For example:

1. I had a small home business--I had to upgrade (wasn't so last year;
2. I had a small amount of royalty income--I had to upgrade (I don't recall having to do that last year);
3. I had to file in a second state--had to pay more for the second state;
4. Filing--I had to pay to e-file each state at a rate of $24.99/state; It's a steep price to have to purchase the program/forms for preparing the state and then having to pay again, for each state, to file those same forms;
5. Paying with a credit card required an additional fee of 2.49%; and
6. It seems I must be forgetting something, as the additional fees seemed to go on, and on, and on.

I'll review my options for next year. Too many additional fees--program is inexpensive, additional fees makes it expensive | 45250206|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|103
2 | Many problems this year I have used TurboTax for many years--more than 10. Until this year, I have never had a problem. This year I had many error screens where I had to call in. I was ultimately able to file my returns, but spent hours on the phone to do so. I was assured that this will not happen next year. I hope so. I like TurboTax and would hate to have to switch.

3 | Sketchy if you need advice I like turbotax because if you have a simple return, it would be stupid to file any other way. But last year, I got married to a foreign woman, and they had no idea how to deal with this. The forum gave me wrong advice, and I ended up spending two hours at an IRS office, just for them to tell me that I didn't need to be there, I needed to talk to the social security administration. So, easy filing, go with this, but if you have problems, don't expect any real help. Wasted time with their bad advice | 45245889|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|108

1 | Why I will not be using TurboTax again I was made aware, via an email from Intuit, that this year's Deluxe edition of TurboTax would no longer carry Schedule E, which I use for a couple of rental properties I own. Accordingly, I bought the "Investments and Rental Property" edition (at a considerable price increase — $25 more) to do my 2014 return. (The email told me I could get a $25 rebate on the edition I bought after filing, with no mention of a deadline). Imagine my surprise when I discovered, in the midst of filing, that the edition I bought did not include Schedule C, which I routinely use to record small business expenses/receipts. No matter, TurboTax graciously allowed me to upgrade a second time to the NEXT level of service at no charge (I have no idea what that edition — "Professional," I believe — costs, but I'm sure it's a significant increase once again). I finished my tax return and filed on April 24, only to find that the $25 rebate I was expecting is no longer being offered. So, folks, it's H&R Block for me next year (and I've used TurboTax for the past dozen years). Deceptive pricing | 45244902|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|110

3 | Price Increase over the years is no bueno. I've been using Turbo Tax for years. It used to be free (for real free...not "free" and then $130!), and this year I had to pay $130 solely for the services. I understand depending on what you use it for, the price can increase. This year, I had to file for two states...BUT, even if I had one state only...It still would've cost me $100, which is absurd considering my taxes are the most basic you can get. Why has the price gone up so much?! Other than the cost, I appreciate the ease of the service, but may need to look into alternative filing services next year...

3 | BASIC FORMS MISSING FROM DELUX Why should I have to buy the Premier edition? Why isn't schedule D part of the Deluxe edition? It is a basic form that should be included in the Deluxe edition. I will have to seriously consider other tax software since Turbo Tax no longer includes this basic form in its basic program. I heard that Tax Cut is better than Turbo Tax because it includes this form. There is absolutely no reason for this. I will have to cancel my yearly automatic shipment. It was a great run (over 10 years) but Turbo Tax has decided it no longer wants my business. You can be sure that I will let everyone I know about this. basic form missing | 45217695|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|119

1 | Worst Turbo Tax version ever I will probably use H & R Block tax software from now on.

I have used TurboTax for at least 25 years. I always appreciated the guide me format, ability to save as I go, and ability to print mail-in returns and complete copies for my records. This year some forms were deleted from the usual Deluxe version, necessitating an upgrade. You should have a talk with the person who deleted those forms.
The worst part was being put into a computer program loop at the end. The program constantly bugged me to file electronically. I wanted to print a complete copy for my records. When I clicked on print to make a copy for my records, the save to pdf screen came up. I saved the file. After that there was no way to print anything. Fortunately I know how to locate and print a pdf file. (Your customer service link does not give me opportunity to submit comments.) Turbo Tax 2014 WOULD NOT directly print my return | 45215067|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|121
3 | Disappointed Because of the inadequate descriptions, I chose the Primier edition. I find after use that I could have done all with the
Deluxe edition. Last year the Deluxe edition served me well.

I did not appreciate being handed off to another entiry for the processing of the accepted returns. The communication re status of my returns was poor/non-existant.

1 | shame on Turbo Tax I can't believe the questions you ask. Meaningless IRS stuff that I blew by knowing what I wanted to show on the form. But that is not the issue. Have done Dad's Taxes using Turbo Tax for year's. Having last year info in the system is a big help to making this process easier. Dad passed away at the end of the tax year. and I found out in the last minute that his largest retirement (from the US Govt) had not sent the 1099 R. ...Yes I waited to the last week due to personal health issues....I contact the appropriate agency and they acknowledged that they had not sent it out. The folks who processed his death had put it in the wrong pile. They offered to send a replacement and promised I would receive it within 7 weeks. I considered filing for an extension but knew that I could complete the form using an unofficial year end summary that contained everything I needed. I also knew that sending Dad's taxes electronically was first of all easy and fast, and secondly that it did not require the paper copy of the 1099-R. Problem solved. I waited a few more days to complete my forms (much more complicated) and finally was ready to "push the button" on April 14th.
This is when Turbo Tax decided to turn my life upside down. When walking through the final steps the screen came up regarding an electronic signature. Turbo Tax automatically filled it in. I did not even question it. I saw that it was there and went forward and submitted it. Next day I got two text messages. Mine was accepted and Dad's was rejected. (I had looked up my electronic signature on the IRS website since I had special concerns) The email cheerily explained not to worry that Turbo Tax was there to help me and that the IRS would allow me until April 20th to get this resolved. Since I was having surgery on the 17th I pushed forward to resolve it immediately. Once I realized that the information that turbo tax entered automatically was gibberish, I went to the IRS website to get new electronic signature for Dad. That site said it could not process the request. Therefore, went back in the current year of turbo tax to the section that give last year/this year comparisons and fun the AGI. Ran it through turbo tax and the following day got another rejection. I was unable to follow up further do to my surgery. Once released from the hospital, I tackled the task again on April 20. This time I was extra careful to identify the last year AGI directly from his printed forms. Checked and double checked then "hit the button" again. Another rejection. It had to be me! Blaming Turbo Tax never crossed my mind. Time to call Turbo Tax and have them walk me through it so there would be no further mistakes.
I found the number (which is very hard to do since it is well hidden several layers deep) and a woman answered. I told her the situation and she told me that I called the wrong number. I explained that it was the only one that I could find and she finally agreed to get me to the department that handles this. She asked for more information then put me on hold. When she got back she said that she would be able to help me. (Why would I want to listen to someone who wanted to shove me off on another department? I should have hung up but was desperate for information.) One of the first things that she said was that she noticed I did not submit the return on time and waited to the 20th. I let her know that I also submitted on the 14th, and the 15th. She was not impressed. Her tone made me think she didn't believe me. Too bad Turbo Tax did not provide her with that information. To bad that she mad a big deal about it in the first place. That was not my question. She then started to walk be through the process of finding last year's AGI. I informed her I knew how to do that. The problem was that the accurate AGI did not work. I told her that I was feeling that perhaps the IRS automatically rejected ALL electronic transmissions from dead people--but surely if that was the case Turbo Tax would have known an explained that it wasn't an option rather than offering to help me get it done. You can still print it out and send it in through the mail. I asked her how to handle the fact that Turbo Tax had now caused me to file late due to their inability to properly process the electronic submission. Should I attach a hand written note saying it was Turbo Tax fault? She informed me it was not Turbo Taxes fault and I shouldn't do that. I asked her then to provide me with a way to send it electronically. Her response became a broken record....you can always print it out and send it in. Hmm maybe Turbo tax should change their rejection message. Sorry we have no idea as to what happened but if you want to listen to one of our representative who doesn't know what she is talking about please call our number....if you can find it. Bottom line, I got the US govt to expedite the 1099-R thanks to your assistance. They were appalled at what you did to me and put it in the mail the same day. I will now be able to mail Dad's return. I will attach this review to his forms, hoping that the IRS is as appalled as the nice people who expedited his paperwork. My only request: please send me a reason to ever use Turbo Tax again. But, if it isn't compelling, please don't waste your time. hard to understand at times - hung me out to dry with IRS | 45209784|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|125

1 | Irritated Incredibly frusturating.

They should really work out glitches. I accidentally entered in MS in the suffix, kept returning to the suffix page to fix it. would not safe it after I had fixed it tax refund repeatedly wouldn't process taking me back to the suffix page.

It is my first time efiliing and when I called customer service they couldn't tell me what a signature ID even was or where I would find it or what I would have to enter in that section until after 10 minutes of the turbo tax staff researching,

Before the staff on the line started researching what a signature ID was/what mine would be they suggested "why don't you just enter a random number and see what happens"- sounded very trustworthy.

Similar situation for my e-file number.

Their system also charged me $39.99 for an option which takes your turbo tax payment out of your refund when I payed in full with Credit Card.
When I talked to turbo tax staff on the phone about how I had this add on service which I clearly didn't need as I had just payed in full their response was "oh yeah sometimes when you select this service then de-select it this happens (meaning you are still charged for it), we'll issue a refund for $39.99"

A glitch they should seriously fix, that is an absolutely ridiculous response, sometimes that just happens!?! great.

This service is absurd and they should really train their employees to better understand the intake form so they're able to offer you a definitive answer of what a they're looking for. Many Glitches, charged for service I deselected- customer service response- "Oh, that happens sometimes" | 45203786|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|128

2 | filing my turbo tax 2015 Doing my taxes with Turbo Tax this year (2015) I experienced. a lot of intrusion on the software. My refund is still not accurate. As I continued on with my deductions and credits . The calculations seem to cease and the refund amount stayed the same. When contacting turbo tax customer service, their attitude was that of participation instead of profession. The end result shows my credits and deductions in black and while but the numbers are not calculated. they really need to take care of that issue!!!!!!

3 | Turbo Tax all about the upsell I've used Turbo Tax for 5 years to do my taxes. They are simple and straighforward (no home, car, investments, etc.) This year, I filled out my form and was told that I had to upgrade to Turbo Tax Deluxe (59.99 plus 39.99 for state) because my taxes required a 1040 form versus 1040EZ or 1040A. This is a lie. I called Turbo Tax support and was informed it was inaccurate that I needed a 1040 form and didn't need to upgrade. I declined the upgrade and was subsequently asked/nearly strong armed online to upgrading 2-4 more times during my filing process. Shame on you Turbo Tax for trying to do this and misrepresent why. As a loyal filer with your service, you should know better. Got asked 4-5 times to upgrade and misrepresented why | 45196453|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|133
2 | CA Nonresidential Income Tax for a Trust Very little of my trust's income was from CA, yet the tax bill according to TurboTax was enormous. I knew something was wrong but couldn't figure it out for several hours. You need to go into a particular form and separate CA income from other income. This was totally unclear and in my view, would cause many people doing the same thing to overpay their taxes to CA. The questionnaire needs to simply ask that if the trust is not located in CA, then how the income is to be aloocated. There is no way to split income up between CA and non-CA from answering the questions | 45196281|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|134

About half way through, I was informed I needed to purchase the Home and Business to complete filing, which I did for an additional $10 and it blended in very well. I am wondering if it simply listed a "schedule F under Home and Business if that would help??

3 | This years turbotax is worse than last year's 1. Unless it is connected to internet it does not print.
(This was not the case last year. What happens if our server is not working? This is not a smart change.)
2. Too many defaults are hidden and cannot see them.
3. I wanted to do the penality fee calculation for the late filing. There seems to be no way for that. So, I just guesstimated and added it to my extention, so that they will not charge me more.
4. In the past, I could go between the easy step and forms where I am working, but now it does not do that.
5. To see what is going on we have to print them, now.
I ended up wasting so much paper, because of this, this year. Took one whole ream of paper to do the tax. This is the first.
6. Correcting errors, or making changes are so difficult with this year's version that now I end up deleting the turbotax file and start from scratch many times.
7. I would like to be able to only copy the personal information section from another file, but there seems to be no option for that.
8. In the past I could get all the forms that I needed, but now I ended up buying the most expensive one, because the program will not let me into some sections, when I was not sure. I ended up paying for the sections I did not need.

I know you have to make money, but if you make money in the way the customers do not like, your company will die in the long run. Like many things in the US, your company is becoming greedy and worse in your business practice, I am afraid.

I'm not attached to my electronics and as such, maybe I should have specified somewhere to be notified over phone instead. Either way, I would not recommend using TurboTax if you have any complicated information to enter such as contract work or live in a state with high state tax. TurboTax is great in receiving your refunds quick or paying things quickly when needed, but has progressively become more expense in order to use their service.

2 | got took I got to the end and went through the check and printing and filing but some where in the filling I understood that I filed but kept waiting for the confirmation but never got it so I went back in and found that I had not filed 12 days later. It was so confusing that it was impossible to tell. too many questions and thinking it was filed.

the Last part of the return called "File" sucks and I don't know what will happen with my return filed 7 days late because it indicated I was through and I was suppose to get a free state too but did not.

I will think more about not using turbo tax next year. It seems that when one part gets better other parts fall apart, probable that there are too many hands in the pot. I was ok until filing which I thought I did but did not because of confusion. | 45188910|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|143

3 | Not as easy to use as advertised. I found it annoying to have to go through the same questions every time I entered more data. I never found how to delete a K-1 entered in error (which lead to e-filing errors). The state package I used did not allow for e-filing specific state forms (I must wait and see if the state requests them).

It allows for e-filing of federal and state returns for a fee.

I was able to get help from other users of the product. It does not have the flexibility built into other large software providers like Thomson or CCH. | 45182541|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|151

3 | Problems with E-File Love the program and how thorough it is. I had major problems with e-filing. I didn't realize the Federal for 2013 hadn't been accepted.

Both returns for 2014 were rejected. This was a major pain in the a**. I certainly hope I am not charged the fee for my state return. I really don't know why the rejection took place.

This experience really makes me question the overall value of the program and will cost me 4-6 weeks before the refunds. I have gone from an automatic purchaser to one who will CAREFULLY CONSIDER whether to purchase next year after ten years as a loyal customer. e-file was a disaster | 45170325|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|158

This is my first and last time using this CO. I will post my complaint on Face Book, YouTube and any other social media to prevent anyone from going through this sorry excuse for a company and I am going to give BBB a call. The worst is I called this Cstmr Spprt Number 800-845-3970 that they gave me, among others, only to be waiting for over an Hour and after all that waiting I never was able to speak with anyone. The ones I did talk to had no clue how to do their job.

3 | Download problems I've used Turbotax for years and always like how seamlessly it pulls in prior year data and appears to help guide through the tax process.

However, it is always a pain to download the software and instlal it. This year I had to pay twice to install it because a pop-up blocker issue that I couldn't identify was blocking the upgrade I wanted and the state download. I spent more time on this issue than I did on entering and filing my taxes. Downloads can be a pain and cross selling annoying | 45165014|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|172

3 | Where did you get that? I find it confusing because when I input numbers, I don't know where you are putting them. So when you come up with a result that I know is wrong, it is hard for me to figure out how to correct it. I still have to go through all the forms, just as I would if I filed them from scratch.

Also, your instructions said input all these numbers from the 1099B and when I go to the original form, I see I didn't need to do all that. I still have to go through all the paperwork to see what you did. | 45164911|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|174

1 | 2014 state It cost me $40 + 24 to file my state return...

Turbotax cost me $30, so I filed my taxes for less than $100

Why don't you warn users about sudden costs, like the state of VT e-file fee of $24 ??? Do you klnow about this (of course, since you charged me) ... there HAS to be a free e-filing alternative, but you do not appear to support this...I consider this an ambush -- "oh - now that you have filled out all the forms etc, we're hitting you up for another $25 toll if you want to e-file" ....not user friendly and leaves me feeling manipulated...

3 | Eh... It's alright I guess I have been using TurboTax because all my information is in it from year to year and it's easy enough to use. But it's getting more and more annoying in that the pricing changes depending on when you file and what version you are using online, and they are constantly telling you that you might need to upgrade to get a better refund, and after I have upgraded I have never seen a difference in my refund. I guess I get frustrated with the "cost structure" of the program, thats all. The pricing changes often, they keep asking you to upgrade | 45162739|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|180

2 | Didn't make any of the complicated stuff easy Not so great this year. All of the complicated, messy stuff that you really want this kind of software to help make easy is exactly the stuff it handled poorly:

- The input section for HUD-1 closing/escrow fees *for a rental property* was confusing and ambiguous, and guidance was non-existent. It doesn't simply provide box number inputs from the form and categorize them appropriately. Even now I'm not 100% sure what it intends for one to put in certain boxes.

- The mechanism for inputting amortized mortgage expenses on a rental property was buried and obscurely labeled. This is an obvious deduction for rental properties and ought to be right in the main supposed "step-by-step" workflow. Similarly for certain types of fees/improvements that should be capitalized as added cost basis.

- It simply did not handle a return-of-capital portion of a stock dividend reported on a 1099-DIV. Didn't notice it and didn't flag it for any special action at all. (One is supposed to adjust the cost basis of the shares on which a dividend with a ROC is paid). It appears that this error would cause an *under-reporting* of income, which could cause underpayment and penalties!

- It provided no mechanism for entering a return of capital (from dividends) adjustment on RSU shares -- basically there was no mechanism for reporting an incorrect 1099-B cost basis on these types of shares at all. Had to enter them as a normal stock sale instead. Even more bizarre when one considers that it *was* possible to report the correct adjusted cost basis on ESPP shares.

- Nonetheless, its workflow for inputting ESPP sales was horribly obfuscated compared to prior versions of the product. Previously when entering investment sales, it would simply ask in the step-by-step workflow whether they were ESPP (or RSU, options, etc.) sales and then take you through the appropriate steps accordingly. Now you have to enter them generically, then click a little checkbox stuck in the middle of the ledger, then a button, and then select from a slew of options.

- The handling of K-1s was clear as mud. Again the input flow didn't simply map a substantial majority of the numbered boxes on the K-1 documents to entries in TurboTax, making it tedious to figure out what is supposed to go where. It did a very poor job of handling the process for entering ordinary income versus other types of income, etc.

- The handling of publicly traded partnership units resulting in K-1 reporting (e.g. MLP) was just plain broken. It tried to report the sale twice: once from when it imported the 1099-B from my broker and again from the data I had entered in the K-1 workflow. I only caught that it was going to cause me to pay tax twice on the transaction when I reviewed the final tax forms generated at the end for printout and filing. The workaround was very poorly documented and rather bizarre (though apparently in accordance with IRS guidance).

Overall, it didn't make dealing with any of the complex parts of my tax situation easier, other than knowing what forms need to be filled out and providing for the data entry. A pretty high price for a glorified form generator -- I'm paying for this to help make things easier. Disappointing compared to past years. Didn't simplify things, and made mistakes | 45140433|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|192
3 | not free for deductions It's actually a great way to file return, especially for those who have not done it themselves. The instructions guide you every step of the way and there are windows for extra explanations if one is curious about something or has questions. However, in previous years, it had more features that were complimentary. This year the deductions that were included ended up costing me money to do a return which was disappointing considering all the time spent entering the info in, only to learn I had to pay to keep those itemized monies (and bigger return). I liked how it was offered a few years back. Will be looking for other ways to file next year. costs money | 45140367|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|193

1 | Used to work... This year?.... Not so much! I carefully followed the detailed steps for a straightforward filing (W-2s and 1 healthcare form) and was assaulted by rejections for 1 problem. The review would only process one error at a time, dragging out the e-file process for a whopping 6 separate rejections. Why the software doesn't detect all the errors the first time (BEFORE filing would be nice!) is beyond me!!

Oh! Filing as single? Pay for the upgraded product... and then pay YET ANOTHER fee for state filing. Absolutely ridiculous! I will probably never use TurboTax again, and warn everyone I know away. inaccurate reviews of documents/errors before and after filing | 45140092|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|195

Didn't direct me to how to fix the errors rejected by the state, even though it has a button that says "help me fix this" I paid $65 for an extra state return and e-filing, which I couldn't e-file. Some of the questions aren't clear.

I'm also disappointed they pushed the business tax capability from the Deluxe version up to a higher priced product.

I'm seriously considering hiring a human next year even though it costs more. It will lower my frustration level. Didn't catch errors, hard to change entered info | 45139259|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|198

Even when she checked with her supervisor, she had no further explanation. I called the IRS, waited only 20 minutes (!) and they explained without much difficultly that the problem was because i paper filed last year.

Had to go out a buy a cd at the store and download that to be able to use the program. I don't think I will ever use the download program again.

3 | Rejected notice Turbo Tax is efficient and easy to navigate. However, this year I received a rejection code that someone had already used my FIN number (SS#)... the only way to get my 2014 taxes done was to mail directly. It was difficult to get in touch with someone from Turbo Tax to determine how to resolve the issue. Going back into the website there are no good guidelines on how to resolve this issue. Finally I did reach someone but once I did she was not very knowledgeable with how to handle the situation. Turbo Tax representative could not advise me if I should have cancelled my credit card payment and send a check. Ultimately she said that since the payment was pending that the IRS would accept the payment once they received my mailed forms. Hoping that is the case because the last thing I need is to have to pay penalties or interest if the IRS claims they did not receive the payment. BTW I mailed them via Priority next day delivery on April 16, 2014... Issues post e-file rejection | 45130474|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|212
1 | no value in state efile Rest assured I will NOT use state efile next year. Had I used the free online Colorado tool I would be better off. I efiled on Feb 12th, my return was accepted and then went to limbo. It took four weeks before the state acknowledged my refund, and then 6 more to process my refund. If I had used the FREE service, my refund would have been deposited within a week, instead, my bank information was not delivered, and a paper check was mailed 'tomorrow' 4/21/2015. using the free service I should have had my refund deposited by March 1st, nearly two months earlier.

1 | 2014 Not Good I have been a TurboTax customer for at least 15 years. This is the first year I have ever had an issue. When I tried to purchase Audit Defense it continued to give me an error and direct me to the web (which did not have the answer. I thought I'd move on and try back. When I got to purchasing the State, same thing! Except then I would "Try Again", it would double the amount of the State fee I needed to pay (i.e. from $24.95 to $49.95.. it kept adding another $24.95 every time I would try to get it to go through!) the only way I figured out to get it to show ONE state was to start again at the REVIEW tab. It never did go through and I had to call in. After they called me back (the wait time was so long) they could not process the Audit Defense only the State so I couldn't purchase my Audit Defense this year! The lady that processed the State for me was so nice- but still I am NOT HAPPY! Continued to receive an error when trying to buy Audit Defense and State. Amt of State kept multiplying! | 45129404|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|214
1 | Filed early and ended up with major issues I've used Turbo Tax for years. I thought all the new features this year were excellent. That is until 2 months after filing, we needed our taxes for buying a house. At that time my husband reviewed the output and realized that even though his name was present in the W-2 section - there was no income showing up! How did this get through the TurboTax process without any error?! I have no idea. All I know is that we now owe over $8000 in taxes! URGH. Next year we'll be using an accountant.
OBTW called their 800 number and the person that made some lame attempt to help me knew nothing and didn't sound like she was old enough to drive! Once she figured out I wasn't going away I got thrown over to some black hole number where you "leave a message" - let's see if they even bother to call me back.

3 | Got thru it Your knowledge of Schedule F and associated depreciation
leaves a lot to be desired---something happened a few years ago as I have a h--- of a time doing my farming--- you no longer have line item in Schedule F for Depreciation who's value comes from a depreciation schedule--- so I have to put it down as a "misc" item which is a sure flag for IRS

Please readdress your attention to making it more farmer friendly as I might have to go to another system---I have talked to your folks for a couple years, and while there is sympathy--- little has been done to correct it.

perhaps review how a Schedule F needs to be completed and go from there You ability to log in past depreciation taken in previous year and to keep track of it for Schedule F lacks | 45128807|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|217
2 | TT Deluxe 2014 - Not TT's best release As a student, I thought I'd file online for free...until I got to the notice that (1) I had to upgrade to TT Deluxe because I cashed a small 401K in 2014 (an upgrade cost of $54) AND (2) was told in error that I had to file a Tn return because of the 401K (at a cost of $39.99). So I bought the Media version (free state at the same price as the online "upgrade") and reran the numbers. The online OPTIMIZER correctly assigned The American Opportunity Credit. However, the Media version incorrectly assigned Tuition Deduction, greatly reducing my refund. I spent 59 minutes on the phone with a TT cust svc rep who helped me work around this error. All-in-all it was a PITA. TT Deluxe Media Version has a educational deduction glitch | 45128772|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|218
1 | after 20 years You were hacked in February. I understand that. But to still not recovered from it a MONTH later is inexcusable. I wasn't able to file my Alabama tax return until FIVE DAYS after the deadline because of the "State loop" glitch in your program. THEN, after a conversation with a nice young lady somewhere in Missouri, I attempt to e-file and find ANOTHER (insert expletive of your choice here) GLITCH in your program - the e-file payment snafu.
For Intuit to change there marketing of your product (after 20 years) to suddenly no longer provide assistance to the self employed with either the "deluxe" or the "premier" editions, is bad enough. But to shoulder the blame with a simple "oopsie" is insulting. Compound the insult with pathetically pitiful quality control of your product and I find myself at the door.
Good bye Turbo Tax. It was fun while these past 20 years, but you're not the only game in town and your questionable services are no longer needed.
The only other step I can think of is a class action suite.... Your program now SUCKS. Your customer service SUCKS. My experience with Intuit's TurboTax is OVER. | 45125559|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|219
1 | Sick of the problems Last year, TurboTax had a technical glitch that prevented me from e-filing. I had a ridiculously hard time getting anyone to pay attention to my issue, and when they finally did, they told me it was my problem, and that they weren't going to be able to fix it. This year, I tried to e-file, and my return was rejected. Again. TurboTax will let you efile over and over, and get rejected over and over, and their solution is to print and mail. I think for the money that your company makes on your software, it should work, and when it doesn't, you should make it easy to get help. I am going to seriously consider going another route next year after 10 years with you. Can't efile | 45119550|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|220

1 | Employer ID issues My federal return was rejected, because the employee ID was incorrect. When I entered it exactly as it appeared on my W-2 it would not accept it. There were not enough spaces, (one too short). I tried to go back and remove a dash that was in the number and when I'd move the curser away, the software would automatically enter a dash, which made it so I couldn't enter the final digit. This seems very clunky for 2015. Eventually I removed the whole employee number and reentered it, which made it finally work. I did not see any instructions addressing this issue, or even stating to leave the dash out. I even put in a service request over a week ago for questions I had while I was in the process of working up my taxes with the software, and I never heard back from anybody. very touchy for simple issue | 45095609|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|222

3 | 2014 Tax Review I ran into problems putting individual 1099 Misc forms for Royalty income using H&R Block the last years. Switched to Turbo Tax in hopes for better function. The input of most data into Turbo Tax is generally good, better than H&R Block. However, I ran into a similar problem with IRS Sched. E. Turbo Tax takes LLC Form K-1 very well, but also fails on individual 1099 Misc for Royalty income. It is completely opaque on correctly accepting that data. It appears Sched. E is the correct place for Royalty income, but there is no apparent access. The input of individual 1099 for Royalties into IRS Schedule E is also a big problem. | 45091518|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|225

2 | SO FRUSTRATED Turbo Tax bounced one of my state returns.No problem, I fixed it and all was great.

However when I corrected it on Turbo Tax on April 1st, the amount DUE on my HOME state's return CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY from owing $479 to getting a refund of $128. Yay!! HOWEVER , even though those changes are on the return per Turbo Tax, they never changed its report to the State!!

I was charged $479 by my home state on April 15th instead of getting the $128 refund.

It took me over an hour searching and completing forms on Turbo Tax just to tell them.

Now I have to mail the Amended Return that THEY calculated 3 weeks ago and did NOT submit to the state. changing it is another story | 45089917|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|227

1 | Spannhake 2014 Turbo Tax Experience Totally bungled the Ohio School District filing. We elected to pay the School District tax by paper, but e-file the return. Instead of printing the payment voucher, SD-100 was printed and Turbo Tax set up the payment as an ACH Debit (we had elected direct debit of State of Ohio tax payment). Had we actually wanted direct debit for the School District tax, Turbo Tax would not have printed any forms. Instead, we manually printed the Payment Voucher, sent in a check as we elected, only to find that the direct debit was processed and we double paid a large amount.

2 | Disappointed in Intuit and TurboTax this year I have been using TurboTax for decades, and MacIntax before that. I was very disappointed at the start and end of the process this year. It took me 45 minutes and a call to tech support to install the software and then (free) upgrade to the home business version needed to get a Schedule C. It required the tech support person taking over control of my computer (very creepy) by me entering "share screen" in a secret location on the TurboTax site.

Once installed and upgraded, the software worked mostly fine until the very end when I went to e-file. When it tried to ask for my credit card info., it hung, and gave a customer support number to call. I called the number, only to find out they are only open 9-5 weekdays. Pretty useless for those of us who work (like everyone doing their taxes!).

So I googled the problem and found a FAQ section on the turbotax website where dozens of other users had the same issue. Thankfully they offered the solution - enabling an obsolete and insecure internet options setting (TLS 1.0) that allowed Turbotax to continue and charge my credit card.

The only other minor glitch was that the program kept asking me for farm income, even though I never told it that I owned a farm (I don't own one).

It is amazing how Intuit is killing off loyal customers, first with how they ruined Quicken (long story - just google it), and now TurboTax. And their customer support has gone way down hill. Next year I will consider alternative options. Broken e-file/credit card, Unbundled Schedules C & D | 45075560|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|245
3 | Good but still a challenge I have used TurbTax for years and believe it does a good job, but I can't help but feel I am missing some very important deductions like my quartlery broker fees to manage my investments.

I am purchasing TurboTax. If I wished to purchase an amazon service, I would go to amazon. I do my taxes and my sister's federal and state taxes using turbo tax and have recommended it to literally dozens and dozens of people. However, I will not utilize it again if I keep being forced to accept or reject the option to purchase other products. I didn't come to this site to purchase, I came to this site to quickly do my taxes. I find it insulting that turbotax is wasting my time and forcing me to accept or reject amazon products.

1 | Unsatisfactory Review Alabama state return e-file was rejected 3 times. Although TurboTax identified what was wrong, they offered, but did not provide, any help fixing the problems. I was left on my own. Could not get a number to call for help. I had to mail my return in late as originally filed and hope for the best.

I could not print out the reason the e-file was rejected. I had to write it down longhand to remember. Was a long explanation.

I'm not sure if TurboTax will be reimbursing my credit card for the failed e-files. Nowhere was it mentioned, nor could I find a route to find out.

3 | Needs updating! I've used Turbo Tax for many years and for the most part it has helped me to file my taxes and find all the deductions that even I might have forgotten. This year unfortunately I had a few problems and Turbo Tax seems to have complicated those problems even further. I was unable to file my returns early this year like I prefer, and due to a problem with my new wife's information I had to file an extension. Normally this is not a problem, but she has not filed for several years because she has not had an income and we were both unaware that she had a pin with the IRS from years ago. My extension was rejected because of this pin and I was given the option to re-file my extension by April 20th. Please keep in mind that my extension was filed on April 15th. Today is April 19th, and I was trying to file my extension along with my estimated amount that I owe the IRS. This is where Turbo Tax is lacking on their side. I cannot send my extension because where I pay the amount that I owe has to be set to pay before April 15th, but it also has to be set to pay no early than today. "?????" How can I send in a form on the 19th when it can only be done if the date is listed before the 15th? Well Turbo Tax you dropped the ball on that one. Next year I'll hopefully be able to file early, before you guys have a chance to forget to update your forms. Very unprofessional....

3 | TurboTax has gotten worse In the last two years, and this year especially, the software has gotten worse - more difficult to navigate and enter information if you're specifically looking for something. When you go back to 're-do' a part of the questions, it doesn't remember everything you put in before, giving you the option to change it. Instead, a lot of your prior responses are simply gone from the options of the screen, so you have to re-read the questions and respond another time. There needs to be a very easy and simple way to navigate through the questions quickly, saving all of your previous responses, allowing you to quickly find the screens with queries that you want to change your answers to. There used to be a simple option to either go through the prompted questions, or to navigate quickly between steps, allowing you to select specifically what you want to view or change. That appears to be gone now.

I would also like an option to start the whole process by entering all of the information from the tax documents that I've received in the mail - ie 1099, 1098, W-2, interest and dividend statements, etc. If you enter all of this info first, you know you can set all of those documents aside. TurboTax could then save the information from those documents and prompt them to review and 'label' them as necessary, assigning them to an individual, etc, as you go through the remainder of the questions for the tax stuff.

1 | Surprise Have been using the Deluxe version since 2007 and really liked it. Would rate 2007-2013 as 5 stars. But what a surprise in 2014. You fixed the Schedule D problem witha free upgrade, but still disappointed with no state return included. You should have highlighted those changes better.

2 | Astonished I’d like to hear how the TurboTax online system allowed someone to create an account and file using the same SSN as me, a long time and current customer of record. Secondly, please contact me so you can provide a detailed written record of all access history to my stored information. It was also easy for the criminal that filed via TurboTax using my SSN | 45068432|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|260
2 | Not too good I really hate this software. I did my step daughters on it this year but switched mine to TAXACT. On turbo tax, I had problems with getting the program to function. It kept freezing up. Would not start the sections when I clicked on them. Many section ask a bunch of stupid questions and waste a lot of time only to later advise that you can't claim a deduction. Also, it never shows you the marginal tax rates or where you stand relative to them, which is important for tax planning. Overall, not that great and too expensive. too much black box function and deceptive about costs. | 45067654|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|261

1 | Turbo Tax sucks You took my money I couldnt e file and now my taxes are late. You guys suck. Will NEVER use your software again and I will make sure everyone I know never uses it. I got this error "amount on Line 60b, 'FirstTimeHmByrRepaymentAmt' of Form 1040 and attach Form 5405 if required.now never uses this software. Which is a known error on your website since feb with no resolution. I dont care if you blame IRS you sell the software to efile. I cant efile yet you still took my $60. Total fraud!

On top of it when the erro came back your software said it fixed it. and i did not! Fraud!!!! Total rip off | 45066758|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|263
1 | Sad news I had used Turbo Tax to figure my taxes and right when I went to transfer returns, Turbo Tax went online to save returns and the program froze. There were two additional aggravating circumstances, the program did not save locally first so I did not have a back up, There was noway around the error, no clicking on reload or cancel. I took pictures of the screen the next morning at that time and would be happy to send them to you. I thought if I let the computer sit until the next day the program would unfreeze, but alas it did not. I had to restart the computer and start all over with my taxes again and file them late. Sadly, it does not matter how well a program assist you with your taxes, it is moot when you cannot file them due to technical issues. program froze up on April 15th can could not file | 45066702|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|264

1 | Turbo Tax Review I have been using Turbo Tax for more than 15 years....I actually think I began in 1998 or 1999. This year may be my last. I am unhappy with you that you "dumbed down" the software, the you charged me more for it, and as far as I am concerned at the end of the day you gave me less. We don't have the assets or deductions to itemize, but I was required to buy the most expensive version of your software just to prepare a schedule c. Not a good investment on my part, and not a good strategy on yours. Unless things change drastically, I won't spend the money on Turbo Tax down the road. I purchased Quicken to keep up with personal finance, but don't like it very much (It thinks I am stupid so tries to recommend WAY too much). I likely would be better off going back to the spreadsheet method of tracking, and filling out the tax forms by hand. You have a long way to go to re-earn my loyalty!!!!

1 | Reject IL State Return: Frustrating + Recurring My recommendation of TurboTax has gone from 5 stars to 1 star, losing one star for every 2 times (Scoring from 9 to 2 on how likely I am to recommend TurboTax to a friend). The 1 star is for ease of use.

In 2013 my 2012 state taxes were rejected once. In 2014 my 2013 state taxes were rejected 3 times. In 2015 my 2014 taxes are on track again at 2 rejections. It is rejected for the same reason every time - a problem with my signature.
1. I don't have a PIN, so following the advice listed on the "we're Here to Help" pages: I include my drivers license number.
2. I submit it each time, and 24 hours later, another email in my inbox tells my it's been rejected.

Even if Turbotax has nothing to do with it, it needs to be communicated clearly PRIOR to PAYING for using the software.

For as much as I paid to use the software, I could hire a CPA. Why bother dealing with this again next year? I would appreciate a response, but if I don't receive one, I'll simply move on.

Disappointed and frustrated, a soon to be former TurboTax user.

It's a shame because I have used TurboTax at 8 years.

maybe I checked an additional box, but I dont think so!

3 | Broke Down at the End I like TurboTax's ethic of close guidance. However, this year it found some issues with my return at the final review and when I hit the "Fix the Problem" button it presented a picture of the box on the actual form for which I needed to supply information, but it did not give any sort of explanation for what was required. When I tried to enter the data I thought it wanted, it simply returned me to the screen telling me there were problems. With no other guidance, I kept guessing answers until it said the issues were resolved. Additionally, it allowed me to pay twice for my TurboTax program. After I entered my payment information but before I filed I returned to an earlier part of the process to make a correction. When I returned to the last step, it told me to enter my payment info again. I figured it had lost it when I went back and that it hadn't payed yet, but I just received my second confirmation of payment email. I imagine it would be easy enough to prevent someone from paying twice. Guidance broke down at the end | 45059596|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|283
3 |  The TurboTax product proved to be easy to use as it has been for the my personal use for over 8 years. The confusion about which product we needed to buy this season caused some stress and grief. I actually completed my return online and transferred the file to a store purchased product to save money. I hope you will be clear next season and offer the same quality product that we have come to expect. I actually purchased two different TurboTax products while waiting for the decisions to be made over which one I would actually need to use this year. One was successfully returned to the store where it was purchased. Tough start to the year for TurboTax! Way too much confusion over product choices. | 45058134|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|284

They told me I was getting $1000 more back than what the government gave me. Also, to this day, they can't get my state taxes correct. Worst program known to man.

3 | Confusing treatment of option exercises The gain on my option exercise was reported in my W-2. Turbo Tax separately calculated the gain effectively double counting the gain. I researched this problem through Turbo Tax help, which was no help at all.

I tried several times to correct the double count manually but each time I tried to correct the double count, Turbo tax over-rode the correction ad re-calculated the gain a 2nd time.

I'm still not sure I've submitted the correct information.

The inability to correctly handle option exercises is a serious flaw in the software.

Separately, I was as unhappy as everyone else over the initial deletion of Schedule D from the DELUXE package. Totally confusing treatment of option exercises | 45057135|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|288
3 | almost perfect I've used TT before. It's pretty easy to use. In 2013, had a tax preparer ask more questions and take the time to explain why. The "?" buttons help, but aren't the best at explaining.

Big reason I don't recommend this is that you cannot change the billing options. I just wanted to file Federal using TT, but was forced to file State taxes with the software. Would be great if I could opt out of a "suggested" software option. Next year I will plan earlier so I can see if other software can produce the same or better results. Maybe I'll buy the CD instead of online program so I know exactly what I'm getting and paying for. cannot change pricing options. | 45056822|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|289

1 | Nightmare! Really!! Right after e-filing, the Turbo Tax program crashed and wouldn't give me access to my account so I had no way of knowing whether my taxes actually were filed. I also was unable to access my Intuit account to even get into the program to ask questions. I requested a reset of my password, but that was also frozen and would give me an error message. So, my hands were tied with no way of getting back to my account or taxes. Today, April 18, I was able to access my Intuit account and able to check if the taxes were transmitted, and no, they were not. I transmitted them today but now I will owe a penalty. This was such a nightmare to experience. So frustrating!! The whole program crashed, I wasn't able to file on time and now I'll owe a penalty fee! | 45056620|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|291
2 | Tough to correct Turbo tax was very friendly all the way to the point where I e filed it. It said everything had been reviewed and was good to go. Unfortunately, my return was almost immediately rejected because I did not have form 8962, the Premium Tax Credit form. It appears that turbo tax, did in fact, do the calculations for the form, but it was not e-filed with the rest of the forms. I could see the individual form that showed numbers that i had previously input as answers to turbo tax questions, but this seemed to not exist when viewing the tax return as a whole- either in the e-format or in the hard copy I printed for my records. Quite frustrating trying to figure out exactly what I needed to do in order to correctly amend my return. tough time amending the rejected return | 45056453|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|292

I tried to put in my 6 digit pin again and it would only take 5 numbers, What the heck is going on?????????? Unable to inout pertinent ddata | 45056026|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|293

1 | Problem with Amended Returen for2014 Overall would rate program 5 stars, with the step by step help to make sure don't miss any deductions and assure all forms are filled out correctly.
The only problem was when got ready to finish return for filing, I some how answered questions about amending a return. The questions were confusing.
Once started an amended return, I couldn't find a way back to original return to file it. I did send a question to support team about problem. I was not able to find the solution for this problem when initially search site. It was later posted to fix problem and I was able to get a person on the phone . She was very customer focused but didn't know how fix this problem but encourage my efforts, which did work at 11:28 pm so got taxes filed====so what frustration and sweating.
Used TurboTax for over 20 yrs for personal & business taxes with no problem till this year. Please fix this in next version.
I will continue to be a loyal customer and advertise it to all my friends and family. Dr. Thomas Brown Change the questions on amending a return so don't accidentailly start process | 45055586|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|296

3 | Functionality Your product doesn't seem to be getting easier, it is getting less helpful. My tax situations haven't changed either or are no different than what I have had to deal with in the past. Nothing new to deal with. Transfer from last year should mean transfer all data and ID where if came from and provide cross reference by mousing over and show link/address/etc. More explanations. Help is useless and should again relate to the section you are on. Using the community is a cop out and has always been a pet peeve of mine. You end of with instances of multiple answers and no clear indication of which one is correct. You also try and fool people into thinking some of these people answering are related to or associated with or employed by intuit. getting less helpful over the years | 45054917|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|298
3 | Easy to use But too expensive TurboTax is easy to extremely easy to use and quick. If you can file your federal return free - it's the best deal out there. HOWEVER, you have to pay - it's just too expensive! You must pay for state returns regardless - again, just too expensive for the average person. It brings the overall value of TurboTax way down unless you have a very, very complicated tax return.

I went back in & changed my boys to file joint. Could not get the insurance part to realize it had changed from separate to joint. It keep wants %'s. I had to start a new return to get it done.

I thought my return was filed. I never heard if the IRS accepted my return or no. it was not. I went back in to file a return. Turns out I used the IRS pin # but Turbo tax put in the amount from last year. I did not know I had to delete one or the other. It is a good thing I had a refund.

I also did not know how many returns I could e-file until mine was filed & it was in the small print wanted me to buy a different version if I was filing for more than five people.

2 | Deceptive additional state efile cost TurboTax is an elegant, convenient tax preparation program. It downloaded my business records from QuickBooks. The process was very convenient. I like the questionnaire approach that is used to gather my information.

However, I dislike that annual pricing has substantially increased over the past few years for TurboTax. My daughter has a very low income, but some business income. Turbotax would not honor their advertisement for free file for her because of about $1000 of business income.

I paid for this Home& Business software version that includes Federal Returns & Federal E-file and State Returns. However, when I went to efile my state return I was informed that I would have to pay an additional $24.99 to do so. efile of my state return should be included at the price I paid for the software. I consider this deceptive to advertise state returns, but then to require additional payment at the time I attempt to efile.

I will be shopping for a competitor's product next year. I hope H&R Block provides an appealing alternative. Required additional payment to efile state taxes | 45049230|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|306

3 | Frustrated with the 2014 Premier edition I was very frustrated this year with this version of TurboTax. In the 30+ years that I have been using TurboTax, I have never had so much trouble in entering my data and having it transfer properly. Especially had difficulty with Its Deductible and importing the data.
The extra info that Form 8283 required was just about impossible to correct. Also, all overrides came up as errors but only because you apparently can't use overrides if you are filing electronically. There should be a question about filing electronically - I think there was one near the end of completing info. If you answer NO then overrides should not continue to come up as errors. They could be shown once to give the preparer the opportunity to correct them.
My federal return claimed numerous errors - they were all related to overrides concerning my non-cash charitable contributions. The overrides were the only way that I could get the info required onto the 8283 form.
Your program showed those errors on the review of the Federal tax return and again on the final review after completing my State tax return. Also, when the mention of errors comes up the only option is to review the errors - you can't say to skip them.
I took the time nearly at every place I was having problems to give feedback naming the location and explaining my problem. On your feedback requested I could not tell if the page or screen view that I was on would be known to you.
Having said all this, I have used your program for I think over 30+ years, with very few problems. I remember that the first year that I used It was a wonderful experience. My returns have grown more complicated. This is the first time that I have had major problems with your program. I hope that my comments will help you improve your program for 2015. Info ($ amounts mostly) did not transfer with correct amount and difficult to correct returns. | 45043230|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|313
3 | Mr Fernandez I liked the online service but seriously I would stick to the software. I can do more taxes from family members and the online service is only for one person.

2 | Did not handle stock trades well Very poor and inadequate handling of wash sales, short sales or stock trades multiple brokers.

3 | Turbo Tax Deductions and Homeowners Deluxe Your steps to fix return did not work in my case. Only errors that showed up were related to when to withdraw money to pay my taxes! Because your program created errors on my return. If you cost me a penalty I will be very angry. Impossible to fix errors on forms. I don't know wheere to go or how to get there.

3 | Can't be any more complex An example of my annoyance. With foreign income, the software accepts a certain types of entry for state, zip code, employer's Id etc which have to be fictitious. As for example, UK does not have 'states', 'zip codes' and banks there do not have 'ID recognized by IRS'. But having accepted certain 'fake' entries (suggested by your experts) it shows up those as errors and makes it impossible to satisfy the software and reach the end for filing. It is downright stupid and wastage of my valuable time to sort out. Ask you software guys to change the program to make it remember the entries accepted during the main preparation and not to flag those as errors at the end. What is the use of using this software if the program is so dumb and does not help the poor tax preparer to overcome this problem not of his creation? Very unfortunate. Very long winded. Childish way to direct the tax preparation with pictures of experts - serves no purpose. | 45042889|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|317

3 | Great Software...couple of glitches If you list your home office business use as less than 100%, the TurboTax worksheet for IRS Form 8829 incorrectly calculates the depreciation limit and makes the allowable depreciation artificially low by not allowing the full net income from your schedule C, plus or minus appropriate adjustments. TTax calculation worksheet needs to be rewritten for this to correctly calculate the allowable depreciation limit for the home office deduction. Turbo tax will NOT allow you to efile your taxes if you make any manual override corrections on any of the tax forms, so I could not initially efile my taxes and had to get a tax professional to efile an extension request (because Turbo Tax will not even allow efiling an extension request if you have an entry that is manually overridden on a tax form)-- VERY FRUSTRATING! Otherwise, I've had pretty good success with the software, other than a couple of times where the data from a correction did not carry through to make corrections on all necessary data fields, until I went back through and figured another way to work through the problem and get it fixed. Home Office Deduction section has glitches/errors, in some cases. | 45042044|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|319

Deluxe used to handle it just fine. Good thing people complained, and I got the free upgrade after patching TT. I'll be checking a little closer next year, because I know it will cost closer to $100, instead of $50. Nickel and Dimed for the upgrades. | 45041762|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|323
1 | Not happy I was very disappointed. Previously I bought turbotax and downloaded CD to my computer. This way you payed for federal return and got a free state return. This year I decided to prepare my taxes on line and after I filled out everything I was charged for both federal and state returns even though I could not e-file state. My only options were to pay and file or erase all information put into my state return and begin over. I will not do this again and probably won't use turbotax next year because of this.

I have used TurboTax for several years but I was very dissatisfied this year. Was charged extra fee for state but was unable to e-file. | 45041691|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|324
1 | Hidden fees - Will never use again After spending almost 2 hours getting everything in the tax form, they say I HAVE to upgrade and pay $55 to submit. I reluctantly agree, then they add a $35 transfer fee for my depost. It's a bunch of BS and I'll never use this service again. Added $90+ worth of fees at end | 45041576|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|325
1 | Disappointed I'm a big fan of TurboTax. I've been using it for decades. Once you start using it it's easy to get "hooked" because you get familiar with the process (i.e. the software), and also it "auto populates" a lot of your data from the previous year which makes it easier to fill out the forms, and provides automatic current-to-previous year comparisons.

Now the bad news.
(1) The software "auto-populated" my AGI from 2013 as a means of identifying me and doing the electronic signature at the end of the return, right before filing. It entered the wrong number, and my return got rejected. I did not check the number before filing because I have learned to trust the software to get it right. If you can't trust your tax software to do math right, and move data between locations, what can you trust?
(2) I chose to NOT e-file a State return. TurboTax's instructions for paper filing a State return were lousy. They gave the impression of being intentionally confusing. I can only presume the intention because their instructions everywhere else are quite clear. Are they trying to drive business to e-filing state in order to collect the $25 fee?
(3) A mailing address in the State return instructions was wrong. Fortunately I caught it by reading the State return before mailing.

I will use TurboTax again, but it should be better than this by now. These problems are bush league stuff. The 2014 version had at least one bug, and one intentionally imposed difficulty.. | 45041503|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|326

3 | Well, not so sure I did my taxes on April 135h, then found they had not filed. So I refiled on April 17th and both Fed and state were rejected. They said the Payer's Federal ID numbers were wrong. So I rechecked my print out and found I had the right ID numbers. What happened? I don't know. Anyway, I am refiling now.  | 45041442|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|328
2 | really you force to have the business now Maybe it is time to start looking at other options. I can have a professional prepare my taxes and file them for what it cost to buy turbotax and pay the state e-file.

1 | Return turbotax user, will never use again! All I can say is turbo tax quality has steadily declined in quality and important information. Last year I had to file an amended return because turbo tax missed an $8000.00 deduction. This year an error in e-filing my returns resulted in several hours of frustrating time spent following their online instructions trying resolve the issue. The final snag was when they told me to call their customer service but failed to furnish a telephone number.
After another delay I finally was given an Incident ID # and a phone number. After receiving a call back from Jam, who was a big help, the problem was finally resolved. THANK YOU JAN! Doesn't include include major state deductions | 45039704|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|331
2 | Removed All of the Data I had to redo my taxes THREE times because your TurboTax Premier Program kept removing the data that I had entered.
I would save after I finished entering my data and later when I tried to open the program I would get the Program but there would be NO DATA..
Also, in previous years it was much easier to check where the entries came from by double clicking on an entry.Not so much now. I miss the IRS instructions that used to be included in the Program. Used to be much more user frindly | 45039124|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|332

If I find out that it was NOT a Turbo Tax issue then will continue to use. Further investigating is pending.

1 | completely screwed up electronic filing Electronic filing for state and federal did not go thru. Email from TurboTax said go back and we'll show you how to fix it. Went back. Tried online address for IRS they gave, It repeatedly said, "You cannot apply online for pin." Then I tried phone number for IRS, seven times over three days. It never got past entering the birthdate before it hung up. Went back to Turbo Tax after each of these. No contact person, no one to talk to, just referred me to online forums. Then tried entering AGI for last year, again, no luck, and again TurboTax just sent me back to same page on turbotax. Why would turbotax expect that the same thing that didn't work five times would all of a sudden work. Had to file by paper. Meanwhile, don't know if my credit card payments from TurboTax went thru or not. Used this 11 years in a row and will NEVER use it again. see below | 45038959|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|334

2 | Disappointed This Year I have always liked TurboTax since I started using it several years ago. However, this year's filing has been a disaster! First time around, I ccompleted the entire filing and paying information, but for some reason, TurboTax didn't complete the process. So, I redid the entire filing, paying, etc. process again. Today, 4/17, I checked my tax return to find out that it was rejected. I do not know why, but I had to go through the entire process again, after obtaining a different PIN number. I am extremely upset at this whole debacle. I am a retired, disabled person of 70 years and I do not need this added aggrevation. Too many filing problems | 45037918|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|337
3 |  There is no an easy way to update information from prior year once it has been done.
My specific scenario: I started 2014 tax return and I was not done with 2013. It transfer the information from 2013 but when I finally finished the 2013 tax, they information on 2014 still does not reflect the changes made.

Your software does need to create a bottom to update information from prior years to address my point here. Update information from prior year | 45037836|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|338
3 | Potential for Excellence... but.. The product was excellent up until it was time to file. At that point in time everything fell apart. There were JavaScript errors that popped up when trying to connect. Having a technical background I could figure out how to get past those and click the connect button. Once I clicked the connect button it appeared the screen froze - i.e. no reaction.
I called tech support and received my call back. I was told it would be a 45 min wait it was over an hour and a half. When the person finally did call me, she read the issue description and told me it should not have been in her queue. She attempted to transfer me and dropped the call.
During this I brought the screen back up and came to the realization it hadn't froze, it was just extremely slow and it finally acknowledged logon.
Very disappointing experience trying to file.

2 | I normally like Turbo but! Have been having an ordeal with my 1040 and three days later I am not sure if the 1040 I filed was ever accepted by the IRS. From the very first it told me I already filed and it has rejected my return five additional times. Makes me suspect that someone else may have filed a return using my SS# either maliciously or by accidentally. I guess I will find out soon enough. Hope it is not too costly or difficult to finalize. Could not get my copy of Turbo to do a 1041 for me. Had to do it the old fashioned way. | 45037302|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|340
2 | started great and ended up in the dumpster Turbo Tax Case #412133980 - Katina was absolutely wonderful after calling me when I left my number. She stuck with me through and through. Then we were cut off before we were finished and she did not call me back although She had the number because SHE had called me in the beginning. I went ahead and finished and am praying that my IL tax return is not rejected again. If she had called me back, I would not be telling you that there were a couple times when I felt she was trying to get rid of me by giving me wrong information and I had to point out why she was wrong. I had spent a long time trying to fix the rejected IL return myself before I called you. It did not go smoothly and I found the instructions confusing. I truly was surprised that Katina did not call me back because she was patient with me up until she cut me off and I would have given her a great review, if the return was accepted, of course. Illinois was rejected and I spent hours trying to fix, then called you. | 45037105|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|341
2 | wish it was better I thought the program itself for gathering information was good, I think the price was way too high. Also included way too many ads for additional services. When I was finished and found I owed Federal Taxes they still asked me how I wanted my refund. Then when the program asked me how I wanted to pay my taxes due they did not allow me to say I will arrange this with the IRS.

1 | Not Good I hated my experience using Turbo Tax this year. I usually use HR Block. Turbo Tax was confusing and not simple. I was charged for the premium edition in order to proceed to filing. There was no other option even though it CLAIMED free federal return. I was charge $59 for something i didn't want. I didn't even see anything to click on which approved this $59. Even filing the state return was only supposed to be $29 but got included with this $59. Then after weeks of wondering where my return money was, i login and find out the system didn't actually "file" the return. When last time i logged out it was COMPLETE and FILED from what I could see. Not simple. Very confusing and not consistent. Confusing, and misleading | 45036856|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|344

1 | Took advantage of me I got upgraded mid taxes to the small home and business version because it was telling me I had over $100 in expenses (which was only my license fee and fee for insurance), but then never gave me the option to enter it. This cost me $50 more for nothing. On top of that, I have 2 dependents, one of which the other parent claimed as per our legal agreement, but this program still tried to claim him on the EIC this having my return rejected. When I pressed the option to have it fix the errors, it didn't fix anything and just refiled. I ended up having to delete my son altogether just so his ss# wouldn't appear on the schedule EIC. Upgraded me unnecessarily for $50 then couldn't fix errors. | 45036690|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|346

3 | It was nice to be able to do taxes my taxes mysel I bought Turbotax Deluxe because our taxes are very simple. At least I thought they were. We own several MLP's and had some equity sales. II found out I needed to upgrade to Turbotax Premier at a cost of $32.03. I understood I would get a rebate of $25.00 when I filed my taxes. I saw no place to get this rebate when I filed my taxes.
I paid $59.99 when I bought Deluxe 1/5/2015. A short time later it was advertised that Premier was only $54.99 (it was much more expensive when I bought Turbotax).
It took forever to download the Premier upgrade. You did a big disservice to your users by failing to include the additional features for investment income.
The box Deluxe came in said there was 1 State product via download ( Print free or e-file for $19.99. When I went to e-file state taxes it said it would cost $24.95
I used Turbotax a number of years ago, then went to a CPA. Our tax situation has gotten much less complicated and I decided to use Turbotax again.
It really was a pain to deal with this year to get started. I sincerely hope you get the versions straightened out before 2015 tax filing.
HOW DO GET THE REBATE FOR HAVING TO UPGRADE TO PREMIER??? and the aggravation of having to download it??? Very difficult to download updates when I first got it. Site was so slow it shut me out several times. | 45035809|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|352

2 | Inflexible Turbo Tax Although Turbo-tax is good for most normal circumstances, it is a very inflexible tool for inputs. Examples:
--It did not allow for straight line depreciation on rentals or other items, that were started years ago
--It does not allow accurate valuations of land or other assets, if they seem too high (even if used previously with IRS), so does not match current real estate values in many cases.
--I was unable to fill out a schedule E properly, so had to include the data in other schedules.
Bottom Line is that in many cases you cannot input your actual data if it does not match their parameters, regardless of why. Strict limits on data inputs--not allowed to input special circumstances within tax rules | 45028277|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|360

This was one of the few things I thought I could still rely on being the same reliable safe, free place that it was. What a disappointment. changed to: ad pushing, upselling and no more access to your own returns w/out $$$$ | 45027734|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|363
3 | Refund done overall I like the ease of use of the application and be able to do it at my pace but do not like all the pop ups that I "can't do that" without upgrading and spending more money. would not let me do certain things w/out upgrading...again | 45026889|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|364
1 | Turbo Tax got it wrong, and there's no one to talk 1. If you receive a distribution from HSA when you had no HDHP plan, even though you used the entire distribution for qualified medical expenses, TurboTax added it to taxable income. That is wrong! Verified that with an H&R Block specialist, and then further verified it with IRS publication.
2. Posted a question, got no help.
3. Plan to change to H&R Block next year...I suspect TurboTax makes me pay more tax than I need to. 1. Incorrect handling of HSA distributions for qualified expenses. 2. No help when asking for clarification. | 45026741|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|365

1 | Experience was poor, cost was high The transaction between TurboTax and the IRS is very poor. My stress is huge right now because I can't get the two entities to talk. TurboTax thinks I have one AGI, the Government doesn't agree but I can't get the AGI. First the link get the ePin won't complete and says it can't be provided online at this time. The IRS phone number then says I don't need a PIN this year (yep it did) so trying to enter last years AGI which TurboTax enters automatically.... but it doesn't match the IRS. So try to put in 0 as the Government says but it still rejects. This isn't a convenience it's a blind battle with nobody to contact. I think your site Sucks!

1 | Expensive software I have used this product for many years now. I have a home business and I found this year I could no longer use the Deluxe version. Instead I was forced to use TurboTax Home & Business. The software is substantially more money and while Intuit laughed all the way to the bank, I was out substantially more money. The $25 rebate does not help since it will likely be difficult to get and I just filed my taxes on 15-April. I'll be using another product for filing next year. This is one customer Intuit will not get back. Yes, they are a big company and I am a little taxpayer. But my decision and people like me will have an impact on their bottom line and that's all businesses care about - lining their pockets with money - not their customers. I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I'm absolutely furious about this year's "pricing error". The software is too expensive for home business users | 45019840|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|372

No TurboTax advice on what to do about NY state requirement that e-filing is mandatory. Will mail it and hope. No response from help question submitted.

2 | Satisfaction Plummeted We were unable to successfully file, apparently because we need a special PIN, but we were unable to navigate the system to obtain one.

1 | Continued Creative Price Gouging Any opportunity to gouge an extra dollar out of you, be sure Intuit has thought of it, and added it. This is the 10th year I have used TurboTax and it consistently gets worse and worse. I spent $70 on the CD this year instead of doing it directly over the internet, thinking it would be a once and done cost.... WRONG. Another $24.99 if you want to e-file state taxes. It says e-filing the Federal taxes is free, but it will only allow this option if you pay the $24.99 to e-file the state taxes. If you want to use your refund to cover that fee, it'll cost you an additional $39.99. Definitely the used car salesman of the tax prep industry. Feel dirty after using it | 45019276|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|377
2 | Somewhat Difficult I really struggled with stock transactions this year. In prior years I was walked through all of the details of different stock transactions. This year they were all originally put in as a regular stock transaction and I had to search for a way to designate an RSU, NQSO and ESPP transaction. I am not sure what changed but it really took me a lot longer to do my taxes this year with Turbo Tax compared to the last 15 or so years. I have to admit I was frustrated. I had to really search for information and the guide was not helpful with stock transactions | 45019270|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|378
3 | Idiot proof? I'm currently on my 3rd attempt to file. Having problems identifying the correct e-Filing PIN to use. Then going to the IRS phone service for Pin problem they tell you to enter 0 for AIG. I'm still not confident it will be accepted this time.

Handling stock options, short sales and futures transactions were all very vague and confusing.

Not sure if I ended up with the same deduction in differently places. - it would be nice if deductions would have had an item summary of the for the entire filing. Very weak on investment handling and then providing visibility of what's imported | 45019251|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|379
2 | Not sure how $59 became $89 I selected the $59 package and ended up paying $89. I'm not sure I like the idea of a company filing my taxes for me if they don't realize that 59 and 89 are different numbers. deception | 45019228|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|380
3 | Disappointed Both my returns were rejected for the first time in 6 years. I don't understand the reason why and I definitely couldn't fix it now as you suggested.

1 | Problems I spent over one hour with one of your customer reps (who was very friendly and helpful); however, the software didn't break out my wages/income very well. I was on active duty in the military for half the year. I was stationed in Virginia, but was a resident of California. My wife was a resident of Virginia for half the year and Nebraska for half the year. I was also a resident of Nebraska for half the year. With the help of your rep I manually had load my wages/income into the Ne tax return...a bit complicated.

Next, I filled several hours before the deadline and found out none of my returns were accepted due to one small EIN typo. Apparently now I have to pay multiple late fees and send the Virginia file by snail mail. I feel I should not have to pay multiple late fees due to the typo. If I filed by snail mail and had the same typo, I wouldn't have to pay such fees. Didn't easily break out income from different states | 45019067|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|385
3 | FRAUD DEPARTMENT IS HORRIBLE I needed to contact the Fraud Department because my return was rejected. It appears my SS number has been compromised. The first time I was sent to the Fraud Section, I waited for 45 minutes. I hung up, called again and was transferred to the Fraud section again. This time I held for 55 minutes and no one ever picked up. Finally, I called again and the CSR I talked with said that he would check to see what the wait time would be--he came back and said, "they told me it would be about 15 minutes." Their concept of 15 minutes does not equal the 40 minutes I was on hold AGAIN. I hung up and have not called them since. Length of wait time (55 minutes for 3 times) to talk with someone in your Fraud Dept. Waiting this long is unacceptable. | 45018962|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|386
3 | Payment for TurboTax As one of hundreds of thousands (millions?) of US citizens living outside the US, I couldn't pay for TurboTax with my credit card because Intuit still doesn't accept payment by credit cards outside the US.

1 | Disappointing Used Turbotax for years with no problems. Now I try to file and cannot because it's "determining my best filing option" for hours at a time until Turbotax finally times out. What's better is that when I attempt to contact Turbotax for support, not only do my inquiries go unanswered, I discover other Turbotax users have experienced the same problem with no response or help from Turbotax as well. Tax season is stressful enough without having to deal with Turbotax's technical problems or lack of support. I eventually had to use a less sucure connection to complete my taxes, therefore I WILL be suing Turbotax should ANY of my confidential information be corrupted... In the end, to Turbotax, all I've left to say is fix it or take it offline! When all's said and done, it won't file!!! | 45018676|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|388

3 | Dazed and Confused First off I selected the "DELUXE" instead of the "FREE" and never caught my mistake. My dad paid for everything because I didn't have the money and then we found an error I had made #fat fingers#. After paying there was no way to fix the error or ask for his money back because there is no contact numbers. We ended up :AMENDING" the return and mailing it in and now I'm writing this review. Next item is if the system will let me log out without telling me that I haven't finished yet. Picked wrong and a mistake; Couldn't fix easily | 45018587|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|390

I had to file an extension so I could get the information together to file a paper claim. I paid for the Turbotax, the $39 for the state download and did not receive the product. You have to help numbers, only an online answer board which is completely useless. I will never use it again and everyone I know, I will recommend not using it. It's a bad product.

1 | Three Steps Backwards I've been working on my taxes for the last two days, and although I submitted my federal taxes, I can't get my state taxes submitted electronically. Today is one day after the deadline, and still no luck. Regardless of what I do, I continue to receive this error message"

Check This Entry
Hidden Right for Me Worksheet:Deduction for health plan is not between the prescribed upper and lower limits.

This is Tax Software, so why would a company develop tax software, that will display an error message and NOT provide a highlighted field that lets the customer know where the error is.

The worksheet that opens in the TT window, doesn't contain any data or information related to Health Plan deduction. If there is an error with the Health Plan deduction, why doesn't the window with Health Plan deductions open.

I don't see anything wrong with my Health Plan deductions because I don't have a High Deductible Insurance plan.

I called and spoke to a TT rep, and the issue is still not resolved. I can't file my State Taxes electronically.

I paid $48.00 for the Deluxe TT software, and the software doesn't allow me to electronically submit my taxes for my state. It seems like the TT product is going down hill pretty fast. I'm not sure if there are others out there that have experienced the same problem as I have, but this is extremely annoying, to say the least.

Theres always something that the software misses. A transposed number that throws the math off. A question that wasn't answered, etc. Even though it double and triple checks your info, it still seems to find a way to miss things.
Ex. There are multiple places where you put in a SSN. I had numbers transposed in 1 out of the 4 places and TT never compared the numbers to catch any of the mistakes. Same with other numbers that you have to type in more than once.

WAY too many commercials. They have value but for me, NOT MUCH.
Other than that I like the program. Easy to use. Easy to make mistakes. WAY too many adds and too much room for error | 45014487|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|411
1 | 2014 turbotax— NO FUN! in fact, disturbingly bad! turboTax Delux has been a great program for DIY tax preparers, such as me. i've used it for 15 years or more. it's great in that it carries over data I've input from year to year, so i don't have to start from scratch. this year, it was bizarre asking me to download free upgrades to Premier, and HOme and business…which required a lot of data reentry.

then it was missing the handy sidebar that let me select which page i want to work on. overall it took me way longer than normal to do this annual chore. this year's a loser: DELUXE has worked for me for years. this time "free" upgrades asked data to be reentered many times | 45014412|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|412
1 | Corrections fails to work I had my return rejected for a typographical error. I logged into TurboTax to fix the error, and clicked the 'fix my return' button. I fixed the error, and resubmitted. Minutes later, I received another rejection notice.
I followed the same steps as before, but this time before transmitting my return, I double checked the actual 1040 file, and the update was never actually applied to the form. I had to actually go into Personal Info to make the correction.
This wouldn't be a big deal, except that I thought that the update from the button would actually make the correction. Big Bug, would rather you just told me to fix the issue, instead of making me think the button link would actually do what it intended.
Multiple issues this year with core functionality. I will likely use H&R next year. Corrections link doesn't update the informationr | 45014231|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|413

2 | E-file Rejected I have used Turbo Tax to do my families taxes for multiple years and have never had a problem. All of my previous returns allowed me to use the free addition; however for 2014 I was not able to use the free version for State so I had to pay $29.95. Well this was also the first time my taxes have been rejected when e-filing. Of course the issue has to do with the TIN error so you cannot e-file; you have to file by paper. Part of me feels like even though I paid to be able to efile my State that somehow the rejection was caused by Turbo Tax. Unable to fix rejected claims | 45013663|0|0|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|416

2 | Won't use again I don't understand what has happened with TurboTax. I was a loyal customer and also got many others using the service over the years. However after spending hours (days) preparing my taxes with TT to file my 2013 taxes, the e-filing service repeatedly rejected my filing. After many failed attempts, I ended up having to start all over with another service and ended up filing late as a result. I was not pleased about this, but I gave TurboTax another shot to file my 2014 taxes. Once again, the problem happened with repeated rejections and a lack of adequate advice or solution to remedy the problem. Numerous attempts to get PIN from IRS failed, phone calls failed, entering actual 2013 AIG failed, entering "0" for AIG as advised failed. Once again, the time I put into tax prep and countless failed efilings with TurboTax caused me to have to start all over with another service, again causing my filing to be late. I can no longer rely on this service, and can no longer have my time wasted with errors and redundant work. I will use a different tax prep and efiling method for 2015. Last two years filings repeatedly rejected, causing me to re-do tax prep and file with other service | 45013609|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|418
1 | was not user friendly I make a small mistake regarding and check the wrong box in answer to a question regarding whether or not my IRA was open on Dec 31, 2014. I though it asked if I had opened a Roth IRA by Dec 31, 2104.. I tried to get assistance from turbo tax to find out where I had made a mistake and it was 1 very hard to find the phone # to call.... took three calls and conversations with 3 people to find out the problem.. Also it was hard to get to find out that I had to go to the print center to review my form before I filed my return.. there should be a quick link for viewing and printing your tax forms before you file after you pay the turbo tax fee. too expensive, not user friendly if you check a worong box | 45013447|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|419

3 | Another tax year bites the dust This year, as those in the past, I've had to complete multiple returns (joint, kid #1, kid#2, ...) and all have been completed with TurboTax. But, completing the kids returns requires information from (a) our joint return and (b) each childs return needs information from the other kids. Since I've been using TurboTax for all of them you'd think that the #'s could be fetched/updated automagically (select parents return, select other childs return, ...).

2 | Awful for part year residency I used turbo tax for state part year residency for my husband and I for Virginia and Pennsylvania. I moved to Pennsylvania partway through the year while my husband stayed in VA. Even though I entered my move date and no move date for my husband. Turbo tax could not get it right when it came to attributing my husbands and my income to the right state. Even though I kept checking for an error. I eventually gave up and filed PA return by hand. Also, it would be nice if it had a box to check if you wanted all of a particular income entry attributed to just one state. In addition, for both federal and state, any time I needed to make changes/updates, I had to go through questions irrelevant to the change. You could rarely select just the page you need to change without needing to re-answer questions in that section, which was a real time sink. Terrible for part year state residency. Also, not user friendly for making changes to just one section w/o wasting time | 45012762|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|427

FURTHER, tried to efile State but required a credit card. I used my mother's credit card, THEN was prompted that I could NOT efile State, AFTER CHARGES WENT THROUGH!!

3 |  I purchased TurboTax Home and Business version to file taxes for a lawn care business is started last year. When I installed it, for some reason, it thought I had the Premier version and wouldn't let me fill out the section for self-employment. After about 30 minutes on the phone with customer service, they finally resolved this issue. Then when I got to my State return, the program wouldn't download the correct paperwork for my state return. After about an hour on the phone, customer service was finally able to resolve this problem as well. These glitches seem totally unnecessary for a program that has been around this long.

The option is there but the program wont allow it to happen.

2 | TurboTax SUCKS! TurboTax used to be my hero, making doing taxes simpler and even fun. Sadly, it really changed for the worse this year, in part because I got married in 2014 (and that opened up a big can of worms in terms of new forms, concepts and absorption of "the marriage penalty"). I used to be able to do my State taxes for free, then print and mail them; now, even after buying TurboTax software, they're charging me to do State taxes with their software, and then charging me again to e-file them. That's taken my $192 refund from Federal taxes to nothing! I expected TurboTax to make doing taxes a breeze, like it had always been in the near 15-years I've been using it. This time, and my last time using TurboTax, it's been a horrendous trip I never want to take again. Next year it will be TaxAct, or get acquainted with a CPA.

1 | What Happened to the Product that I Loved? I have been a customer for 6+ years. One of the biggest advantages was being able to compare to a previous year. This year, I did the deluxe version that I started through either Fidelity or Target's benefits website ( I don't recall#. I used my same user ID as previous years but it pulled in less than 10% of my prior years information.#it looked like just part of my data
from my 2013 W2 maybe??# When I looked up a solve, it told me that if I had used a CD last year, that I would not be able to pull in my last year information until I had paid for this year since I started it from the web as a free version - #which it wasn't it was the deluxe version). So, I did pay. Once you had my payment, and tried to load in last year, I received a message that since I had paid, I was no longer able to start over and pull in my last year info. UGH. I had to re-enter in everything - charities, bank and investment info- you took away one of the best features.

My second issue was with the user interface. ICK. I'm not sure if the UI difference was because of not having all the last year info so it defaults to another version, or whether it was updated for all versions, but it is not as comprehensive as before. Some help was improved, providing basic examples which helps. But, the section on HSA is especially bad. It asked me to get information from a form in my 2013 taxes that did not exist. After so many years of loving the product, I am very disappointed. No Last year comparison, not as comprehensive as before, unclear and just plain bad directions and help. | 45010147|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|443

2 | Your program crashed innumerable times. Microsoft closed down my Turbotax '14 innumerable times. Then of course they ask you to send a report to Microsoft. That always got lost in la-la-land necessitating a reboot of the system.
Time lost was immense. Frustration, extreme.

I have no idea why the problem arose this year and not in the past.

Form 8903 was not in the forms list. Turbotax was totally unconcerned that while I reported Domestic Production Activities in prior years, in my initial go through, I had missed it this time. The 8903 deduction turned out to be $5600, as was typical in the recent past returns, yet when I overlooked the interest from a meaningless credit union account, about $25, Turbotax went crazy with reminders.

I'm having to submit by mail at this point, and it's after April 15th. I don't like being in this position.

1 | Used to love turbotax, never again I've used turbo tax for 10 years now, and other than the ever increasing price, had no complaints until this year. It typically takes me about 30 minutes to do both my State and Federal forms, this year it took hours.

This year the major issue was getting stuck in loops where when validating the form I would get "Name should not be entered directly on worksheet" errors. After numerous tries of correcting the error, and multiple logging in and out,, it FINALLY cleared by using the instructions here (https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/1900432-error-ssn-name-address-etc-should-not-be-entered-directly-on-worksheet)

Then I had a persistent error where it wanted me to correct entries on form 2555, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. That was scary as all get out because I have never had any foreign earned income whatsoever. All of my W2s did not show any at all, and the provided help to search in the income section for it got me nowhere. There simply was no mention of it at all.

I eventually just deleted all of the entries out of the 2555 form manually.

Fortunately, I am due a small refund, so will not be penalized for filing a day late, but essentially in 2015, I just paid $124 for the privilege of wasting hours fighting errors. Never again. Endless error loops, and problems | 45007511|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|448
3 |  Turbo tax is a efficient way to file taxes. My only complaint is I received a thank you for filing and with a E pin #, however my payment was never deducted from my account and today I went back in and resent it with another saying the federal return had been accepted with the new date being today 4-16-15. I do not want to have to pay a penalty for late payment when it was filed 2 months ago.  | 45007494|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|449

2 | Retired I can't decide whether you are victims of your own success or, you've become yet another prime example of the Peter Principle. Thank God I'm retired. In forty+ years of senior corporate Management, its sad to report that the causes, the symptoms, and typically the end result are obvious to everyone who doesn't fall under that harness..

For openers, you're focusing on trying to squeeze your core competency into a multi-revenued monster with products and business which only seem on the surface to be compatible. Not at all common after a buy-out with the buyer trying to 1.) Force the acquired into its existing mores and practices. Management see a bump in revenues, get their 8 figure bonuses, loose all interest in the "newbies" in favor of potential higher rewards where they perceive the grass to be greener. And, of course, strap with a restrictive budget short on training and successfully integration. The streets are adrift with legions of, what were, huge potential companies and executive talent, now tarnished.

2.) You've lost intimate contact wit your customers. Both last year, and then (sadly again) this year problems arose with my returns that one, or maybe two, short phone calls would have resolved the issues and we could have all moved on. Ever try to contact one of the people working on your returns. Can't be done. What's sad is that its obvious your system was structured that way. No direct phone numbers numbers, fax numbers, or addresses for any kind of direct access. Tsk Tsk....shame on you. Customers never develop brand loyalty to tightly controlled, response only emails. When you lose direct customers, even loving control, you lose that customer because you never established loyalty in the first place. Ask Lee Iacocca, Warren Buffet, Phil Jackson. Yes, yes, I know that rarely those this kind of philosophies steal into any curriculum at the Harvard Business School, that's such a pity.

There are dozens of signals that you and your people that the coarse you've recently embarked on just doesn't" look good" on you. Bait and switch marketing on captive customers doesn't sit well with customers who are under a fair amount of stress in the first place. I'd wager that a fair number of them buy that only remotely stuff just to grt you to quit pester them and GET BACK TO WHY HE'S THERE. Its reminiscent of kicking a guy when he's down. You'd never see John Wayne do that. Peace..... What happed to that company.Maybe I'll find them next year once more. | 45007148|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|451
3 | Have a ways to go to simplify State Tax Filing PA State tax software had long-running script issues that made it hard to go from page to page when I clicked on 'continue.'

I had difficulty purchasing the state software, because intuit did not recognize my e-mail address as a user ID.

I don't understand why TurboTax does not keep track of carryover expenses from year to year, or at the very least, tell you where to find them by line number on your Fed & State submitted forms. What's the point of using the same software each year if it doesn't remember/transfer these types of data from the last tax year to the current tax year?

Fed Tax software is better, more user friendly, except for the depreciation/capital improvements area.

Usually the call center has helpful individuals ... it just takes a while to get a hold of one or have them call back. State Tax questions are confusing/unclear, not explained well | 45007073|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|452
2 | Pain in the Neck TurboTax really dropped the ball this year. The software was easy to follow but I had to call several times. I couldn't file state taxes without calling for a code and making my payment over the phone. I filed 2 individuals taxes so that was 2 calls made. I needed to upgrade to premier (which TT gave me for free) but I had to call for a code before I could do it. One call took 2 hours! The customer service staff were always helpful and friendly and this is no reflection on them. But the actual product stinks. Had to call for codes everytime I wanted to do something; like file a state return! | 45007062|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|453

3 | Easy to use I found it relatively easy to use the software and it walks you through it step by step. Fairly simple even when having to add additional data.

When it came to the state section would like to be able to pick an option to print to file manually easier. When I did print it out, the form was a mess and am hoping the state doesn't refuse it for the family's returns.

Would like to have a screen that would show if I or my children were to set up an IRA how much less would the taxes have been.

Seems as though some more effort can be put into to be more intuitive and import information from Quicken easier. Would like it to suggest what changes in withholding to make to avoid a tax bill the next tax year. going back towards end jumps back to start of filing vs 1 screen, state filing option should be easier | 45006598|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|459
3 | okay but hard to review information It seemed thorough but there were a few cons. It was difficult to review what you have input in each section. You had to go into each section and ask all the questions you already did if you want to get to something to check to make sure it is correct. Also in the error checking it should double check when last names do not match when married filing jointly. As it would be the case that most returns filed when married filing jointly would have the same name it would be a simple and good fix to check this and ask you to verify when it doesn't match. Yes it was user error but I had a typo in one of our last names and this caused our file to be rejected. Also it was confusing in the home office section to understand how to input information when we moved during the year and had another separate office for part of the year as well. it was confusing and difficult to understand and took a lot of searching questions and answers (the questions and answers from turbotax was good to have). error checking and difficult to review mid-process | 45006409|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|460

3 | State Fee SUX Lack of a free option to transmit a state tax return is all that is preventing this from being an excellent rating instead of average.

3 |  OK. This beats the effort of actually filling out all of these forms. It says something that filing your taxes is so difficult that you have to pay someone to do it or use software.

1) Filing your state tax should be free for every state. If you pay for a product such as turbotax deluxe, part of the deluxe should be that you then also don't have to pay to file electronically for a state. Intuit could think of this as a national service.

2) This doesn't integrate with all of the companies that I have mutual funds with, so I have to manually enter these. case in point Oakmark funds.

3) Some of the error messages are not helpful. For example, when you install the software one message actually says "< one minute left." Error messages should use words, not symbols.

4) I can never figure out New York State taxes, especially for part year income. Anything that you can do to make that easier will greatly help.

5) This year the charitable deductions don't record when cash donations were made. So if you made multiple donations, you have to add all of these together first. Still could make taxes easier | 45006253|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|463
1 | whatever? Pretty sure my return isn't correct But I'm hitting the deadline so I have to go through with this. It's not as cheap as it leads on. Usually I spend about $40 more to have everything including my payment taken care if with no worry. DONE. This time I spend $60 with Turbo Tax to do everything myself including mail my payment and print and mail my taxes to IRS. I'll never use it again. I prefer my taxes be done right by a professional and not leave a bunch of loose ends. Basically, you pay $60 for a form to fill out.

When filing and getting rejected for birthday dates, have it set up so this doesn't happen. There is a robot on another planet, so TurboTax should be able to figure out how to correspond with entities that have info filed, without getting rejected.

3 | what a surprise!?!? used TT for over 20 years but this may be the last time. All the negative reviews from the bait-and-switch were removed from your site. Totally inexcusable and a violation of the public trust. Cannot wait to see what you do next year to make your program "consistent across all platforms". Review would have been a 5 based on the product and a 1 based on customer relations. irritation from removing features, ridiculous cost of a second State program, repeated attempts to sell addons | 45005208|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|473
1 | Poor customer support I attempted for an hour to find a phone number to address an issue with my rejected tax file. Instead, I was given several questions to fill out on-line. The a page loaded with a "call" button option. I clicked on it, but a phone number did not appear. I tried other methods to find a phone number, but none seemed to load...

3 | ravens4life I use one particular email address. I use the same password. Turbo tax kept saying it was wrong, I had it written down so I know it was not. I decided to change it. When I went through your recovery process it only gave me 30 seconds to recover and then it would expire. By the time I got someone on the phone it would lock me out. We waited the 15 minutes wait time and then it would keep adding an additional 15 minutes. As of this morning it was still showing I had 15 minutes to wait. I created a new email address. My husband was in a serious accident and taxes was the last thing on my mind. With the password issues I ran over into the 16th and now my taxes are late password kept locking out and not easy to recover causing my refund to file late | 45005086|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|476
1 | I will never use Turbotax again! This is my second year filing with Turbotax, the previous 5 years I filed with freetaxusa. Turbotax will not give me copies from my 2013 return to get information needed to finish my 2014 taxes. When I log into my freetaxusa account they have my 5 years of tax returns filed with them for me to view and print if needed. I will not be using Turbotax again to do taxes.

1 | What a Waste I spent the entire evening going over mounds of paperwork in preparation for my usual last minute tax filing. I got through it - with more than a few problems with this software and a headache the size of Mars - but when I got to the end is where it got interesting...it wouldn't let me E File my returns...it still won't as I write this some nine hours past the deadline.

I have used TT for Years, and though there have been a few problems, I never experienced the Anger and Frustration that I am experiencing now. After I calm down, I will be posting about my experience over the last 16 hours on EVERY 'Social Media' network and website I can find related to such issues and BLAST TurboTax with both barrels...I am FURIOUS over this, and the worst part is this: THEY DO NOT CARE - There is Nobody available to talk to until long after I have to go to work...
This will indeed be my LAST use of this product...it's simply junk. The program did NOT allow me to E File...now my returns are late. | 45004473|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|478

As far as I know, I have no control over what # TurboTax uses to electronically file my taxes and now my taxes ended up getting filed late as there was a duplicate # used!
May second-think using TurboTax next year. Fouled up on some # needed for filing | 45003860|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|479
1 | not happy State was rejected, told me we would fix this together, but never showed me where to fix the problem. I could see the issue, but everytime I tried to correct - I could not get to the problem. Embedded in something, pulled from Federal - I could not tell. You market your product for the unintelligent, but when the intelligent try to use it, you have us set up for failure. Not very happy with turbotax.
Also, I corrected items on Federal, final printout does not reflect corrections. Now it is accepted - thanks for nothing. You may not see me next year! rejected by state, you did not fix | 45003804|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|480
2 | Meh When I got to end of my taxes TurboTax was so busy pushing an Amazon gift card on me that I made a mistake and didn't actually submit my taxes. I realized this error in the nick of time, but then, because of my own error, my taxes were rejected. Now, it's the morning of the 16th and for the first time in my life I have been late on my taxes. Thanks, TurboTax. I feel like it was over $100 well spent (sarcasm). I will be finding another method next year. easy to miss actually filing | 45003596|1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|481
1 | Free = $50 Doing a 1040 is extremely easy and can be done by anyone with an eighth grade math and reading level. That said, this service added nothing to a basic life skill in America.

You see the words free several times as you go through the process. "We will prepare them for free." But in order to get a copy to send to the government you have to give them $29. Here is an even funner catch, they automatically upgrade you for another $19 and you can't opt out of that payment either. Turbo tax is ran by a bunch of crooks, and I will never use them again.

However, if you are the kind of person that uses cash advances, and find most things difficult. This is the perfect service for you. It is not free | 45003549|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|482
1 | Nothing is for free! thought this was a free svc. wasn't till the very end on the 15th of April that I was asked to pay prior to filling. I had to otherwise I would have been late. As it turns out after review of what I submitted it was late anyway. didn't realize I needed to put a 0 for AGI. Not using this again everything | 45003491|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|483
2 | Disappointing The "step-by-step" interview process could be condensed onto fewer screens without making it any harder to use. In fact, it would easier to understand some of the questions if they provided more context. As with the actual IRS forms (but for different reasons), many of the questions are ambiguous, and being able to see how and where my answers are going to be used would make it easier to understand what is really being asked.

Also, the MA state health form in particular is really poor. It asks if I was covered for the whole year, and if my provider also "offered" coverage for my spouse -- but this is not asking whether my plan *included* my spouse! In other words, there's no checkbox to say "My spouse was covered by the exact same plan that I was, and with the same ID information". No -- you actually have to enter all of the information for you and your spouse twice. That's absurd. Too verbose, too little information | 45003343|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|484
3 |  The positives are that it's user friendly and it remembers last years information, so that's nice. It also picks up where you left off and allows you to be guided through the process or choose what to work on. Those are some of the positives.

There are also a few things I don't like:

1) Seems like it tries to up-sell you to a more expensive version that you don't need. And when my wife selected the wrong version and attempted to move down to a less expensive version, it didn't allow her to do so easily.

2) It doesn't allow you to enter childcare expenses prior to entering your income (claims that you don't have enough income to claim them). It is usually the case that one knows their childcare expenses long before they receive their W2s.

3) No reminder that taxes haven't been submitted. I thought I had submitted my taxes and set up the money transfer etc. and April 15th came and went and there was no withdrawal from my account (I owed money). I can only guess that I failed to hit enough "Submit" and "Continue" buttons. It would be nice if TurboTax would have emailed me a reminder on April 15th that my return had not been submitted.

4) The turbo tax estimate for what I owe in state tax is far higher than what I end up paying by using the (free) state tax website.  | 45003339|1|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|485
3 | what happened?! I filed my taxes 2/12/15 and told Turbo Tax to deduct Fed owed on 4/14/15. As of today, 4/16/15 it still wasn't deducted so I SENT IT AGAIN! I hope I'm not fined for late payment by the IRS. Turbo Tax was paid by my credit card on 2/12/15, I have proof. missed deadline?! | 45003332|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|486
1 | Tax Prep SUCK You let people know exactly the payment process. I did not know that filing Federal AND states would eventually cost me. It was when deleted my state taxes then I could print and file my taxes. You guys suck, I would not recommend you to my dog!! was confusingin the end | 45003267|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|487
3 | Delux instead of Premier I have used TurboTax quite a few times in the past and I usually use the Premier version because I have Investments. This year I did not have any investments to enter but I needed to carryover Capital Gain Loses from last year (which is just entering two numbers), but I still needed to upgrade to Premier adding another $25.00. I was also charged for my State (more than last year) and possibly e-filing. Finally TurboTax did not try to import my records from last year even though it asks me if I used it, which I did. Had to upgrade to Premier to carryover losses from last year | 45003263|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|488
2 | Needs work If the software KNOWS that you must put a 0 in a field for e-filing purposes, then it should prompt you or do it. Things it KNOWS need to be fixed are not looked at before transmitting | 45002874|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|489
1 | Terrible Tax Program After purchasing turbo tax from Costco I wrongly assumed that I wouldn’t need to pay more later on, to file state and federal taxes. Following this, I entered all my information into the program for it to charge me two times, once for each of the two states that I was submitting a return for. Next, after clicking the “submit” button, I received the message that my returns had been rejected by the IRS due to “the IRS already having accepted a tax return with my same SSN.” When I spent the next two days investigating the identity theft that Turbo Tax convinced me I had been a victim of, the IRS informs me that they have no record of a return on file for my SSN. Furthermore, the IRS has no record of any attempted tax return submissions. In other words, the tax software that I’ve overpaid for is lying to me and will not even attempt to file my taxes. Worst tax experience ever, I need a FULL REFUND! Overpriced failure | 45002862|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|490

1 | Without Warning Everything was going along pretty well until it was time to finalize and make payments. I was not pleased with the extra charges for using a credit/debit card to pay federal taxes owed. The biggest disappointment was the inability to use a credit/debit card to make state payments. I had made arrangements to make both state and federal payments on a prepaid debit card. As a result of these arrangements, there was not enough money in my checking account to pay state taxes owed after discovering this option was not available. It was too late to travel 20 minutes to the bank and make other arrangements at that point. As a result of this, turbotax has caused me to file state taxes late, incurring late payment penalties and possibly interest.

In all, I am not likely to use your services ever again. Insufficient warning of payment options | 45002791|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|493
2 | felt i had no option to pay as much as i had too! I dont remember having to pay for direct deposit. and i feel i had no other options to pay what was 9chosen) for me. the whole reason i di it online is to keep more of my money, I dont mind paying for a service. but i remember paying 30 somthing for tate and about the same for federal, my total was 119.00$ i feel i can go to a tax service and get a better deal than that and thell do all the work. and when it gets to where it can go into my bank account,i never remeber that costing. i honestly am not sure ill use Turbo tax again.... left feeling frustrated with no other option. the payment system implies from the beginning its free, tho ive filed 4 years now, its gotten more expensive it seems. | 45002782|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|494

1 | Take my $ but won't file So here I am in Hawaii finishing my taxes around 9.30pm. I am forced to pay by credit card because you won't direct debit my account until the 16th; meaning I'm out another 14$.

ISSUE: Nowhere does it state you must file by 12pm EDT. By law, I have until 12pm my local time to file. You happily accepted my money to pay my taxes but would not allow me to enter the 15th as the date I efiled.

This now looks like I filed late as the home screen showed an EDT time. I want this to be updated with the correct date so I am not fined. I will also contact the IRS letting them know of what happened. I am certain you will correct the error of your software and make a clear note if you wish to continue this protocol for next year as I'm sure I'm not the only one caught in such a situation. read below | 45002638|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|503

2 | Turbo Tax is clunky this year I've used TT for years, and this version was just annoying to use. There is no way to easily flip between the data entry screens and the actual form view as there has been in previous years. When I got stuck and asked a question, the answer feature would be so much more helpful if it would just link me to where I need to go and enter the info rather than a long list of screens I need to navigate. It would also be nice to be able to return to a previously saved version. It seems that in trying to simplify the process, they removed some of the features I had been used to using in the past. I usually don't love this task, but this year I actually walked away in frustration several times because the program was so annoying.

1 | Fee Frustration - Bait & Switch for State Return! I purchased TurboTax Deluxe and the box specifically states on the back that I can file a state return for $19.99; however, when I e-filed my return tonight I was forced to pay $24.99. A classic Bait-and-Switch. Not only is this fee high at $19.99 but unless I am refunded this $5 this will be the last year I use TurboTax.

Plus, I had one item in my return that required me to upgrade while completing the return from Deluxe to Premier and I was charged $30 to do so. Had I purchased Premier at the store I don't believe the price difference was that significant. I feel that once I had purchased Deluxe version I was taken advantage of when required to upgrade to Premier to handle 1 specific item.

I have been a loyal TurboTax user for over a decade but I'm getting frustrated with your pricing and how customers are handled once committed to your product.  | 45002580|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|507

1 | Go with the other guy Turbo tax is the worst piece of junk software ever. I paid for the deluxe version since it says "state" on the front thinking state was included. No. It wasn't. Still cost me an additional 25$. Then as I'm at the end of everything, ready to submit, it says I can't submit because my version isn't updated. So I do what it says and attempt to update. Then It tells me I'm up to date. Still won't let me file. Keep in mind I'm already annoyed I had to pay for state on a software I already paid for. So I call customer service who gives me a download and sends me on my way to deal with it myself when I've already finished everything in the copy I already have installed.
Don't buy turbotax. File for free and just do your state refund on the state website for free. It's garbage.

Hours later, a disk reinstall, several reboots, a customer service call, an uninstall, a download, and another install later, I finally was able to file. It was around 11:50 when I was at the very final submit screen with my error. I managed to get this all resolved by 3:30am.
Is it my fault for waiting? Yes. I'm busy and a procrastinator. But had the product worked, I wouldnt have had a problem. Everything. State wasnt included as implied. 25$ for state. Extra 35$ if you want that deducted from your refind. | 45002562|1|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|509
3 | Fairly Satisfied Overall, I am satisfied with TurboTax. I wouldn't use it every year if I wasn't. However, every year, I'm extremely dissatisfied with the expensive fees for filing with Turbo Tax. It always starts out free, and I would be ok with a $40-$60 fee for all the work you put in; however, the nearly $40 fee to have the payment taken out of my taxes is ridiculous. And, of course, that fee is not highlighted when given that option to pay. So by the time I saw the fee, I just wanted to finish filing. I find that very sneaky and unacceptable. Expensive with hidden fees that get you in the end - that in my opinion are not worth it. | 45002551|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|510

I have used TT for about 5 yrs and help about 5 other family members to use it, I will really look into other options for next year if TT does nothing about this and also needs to become more accessible to its clients even if we are able to chat with a live person would help..

2 | Ill-Equipped for Those Living Abroad Living abroad, questions were sometimes asked as if one were living in the US, even after I'd indicated I was living abroad. I then triggered an error on their website trying to indicate where I lived (for sales tax credit attempt) resulting in the webpage noting I lived in state '0' (for having not selected a United State). It then tried to make me enter a state at the review process, and I had to recall where in their several-step process that question was and tediously navigate back to delete that entry. Then they tried to force me to pay then $55 to file the 1040 even though it appeared I would be getting $0 refund from less than $1000 federal income tax. questions lacked recognition of living abroad; no easy menu system | 45002522|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|513
1 | Review of Turbotax It should be offered to the consumer all thru the program choice of paying the higher amount or the lower amount. Either to itemize or not itemize. When realizing that in spite of credits and deductions amount owed or refunded would not matter either way. locks you in to the higher package. Only given choice in beginning without knowledge of later status. | 45002515|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|514
1 | Never again In addition to continuous reminders about what a good deal TurboTax Deluxe is, I kept encountering conditions that were not covered in the free federal.
When I logged in, they automatically started my taxes with the business version at a cost of over $100. When I discovered the cost and inquired about the free Federal version, it took me more than an hour to navigate their screens to finally get to the free version, and they required me to start re-entering my data from scratch -- some kind of punishment as another way to sell their other versions. They won't see me again at Turbotax Continuously encountering exceptions that require upgrades | 45002511|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|515
1 | bad Last year I filed with Turbo Tax and when there was something that came back "not okay" I was not helped or defended. They did not do anything but waste my time on the phone in traffic. As if I was not stressed enough, the advice I as given from someone that worked out of their house was...... less than professional. I will not be using TURBO TAX ever again. I will also let other people know that I was left with 22$ (which I was charged extra for putting into my account!!!!!!!!) I spent more money on turbo tax fees than I should of. I did not agree to an upgrade and somehow I was still charged. | 45002501|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|516

(still going to fight it# paid in 2014. anyway. Had almost everything finished went to make a few adjustments and its deductible imported my itemized deductions TWICE... it double and I had to manually removed half of the items! The other CON is at the very end finding out I have to pay to file my state taxes and make an ACCOUNT to do this. I don't appreciate all the EXTRA fees to PAY my federal taxes! Extra charge for using a credit card or an extra charge for taking it from your state refund. I finally pushed the button to file, with my blood pressure up, at 11:57pm 4/15/2015. #would have been a wider margin had I not had to CREATE AN ACCOUNT TO PAY ! GEEZ! just take the money! INTUIT shouldn't require an account! OMG, pulling my hair out!~ Don't make me join your club as the last thing I have to do before filing. THIS upset me. It's deductible imported twice- manually removed half of itemized deductions | 45002473|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|521
1 | Didn't explain PINS... IP versus E-file PIN Turbo tax is great at walking you "through things," but it failed to prompt me that my wife's IP PIN is different than the E-File PIN. I don't have a lot of experience, so that was very necessary for me to be notified of this difference in order to file ON TIME. For a software that prides itself in being user-friendly, I think it failed in this arena completely. I walked through every part of this software re-checking things, yet it took a google search to explain to me that I needed to "search the turbotax bar" in order to find the section that allowed me to punch in the 6 digit IP PIN, as opposed to the 5 digit e-file PIN. Live and learn. May not speak to your specific situation | 45002471|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|522
3 | Hidden Fees The over all experience was god. Turbo tax walked me through the process, I didn't have to worry about missing anything. It saved me time by pulling information into their application, instead of me having to manually input all the information.

I didn't like the fact that Turbo Tax charged me an extra $39, just to have the option of having my fees taken out of my refund. It seems excessive, and it turned me off. HIdden Fees | 45002451|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|523
1 | Efile PIN My wife and I have been issued 6-digit PINS by the IRS because of an identity theft issue. Your stupid program won't accept PINS of more than FIVE digits. This has caused my Federal and State returns to be rejected. PIN Rejected | 45002446|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|524
1 | Could not eFILE I spent 30 minutes trying to delete a schedule K1 which kept preventing me from efiling my federal return. Finally, I entered random numbers for trust number and "Void" on the name of the trust for the blank Schedule K1 that TT would not let me efile and it accepted it. What a waste of my time TT. I ended up submitting my return at 12:05 a.m. on 4/16/2015. If I end up with a late penalty for TT I am going to ask for my money back. It won't let you delete a Schedule K1 | 45002445|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|525

3 | Glitchy state return! This is the first time TurboTax has let me down. Due to a glitch in their California return "Smart Check," it wouldn't let me e-file and of course I waited until the last minute. I would do the "Fix It" screen, fix the error (that a field should be blank), and it would take me right back to the "Would you like to fix the error page?" in an endless loop and then wouldn't let me e-file.

2 | Turbo Tax Plus sale without notice I did not like how you tried to sell turbo tax plus by asking if i like to deduct my turbo tax payment from my federal and bill me for turbo tax plus without explicitly indicating i will be charged an extra $29.99 and i had to jump hoops to find where I might have agreed to pay without knowing because thats what happened. At the end it almost looks like a point of no return and forced to pay. Really Disliked this. Last year same thing happened and not knowing why and how I paid it to get my taxes filed on time. This year same thing happened and I was annoyed as I was careful in not agreeing to any more payments than $29.99 to file for state. This should be stated clearly that if u want to deduct your turbo tax fee from your Federal we will charge you an extra $29.99 for Turbo Tax plus.

2 | State Taxes Filing I had to pay $39.99 the first time, I had to save my work and then go collect some money in order to pay for the amount due on my State filing. When I came back to finish filing it, I had to PAY again, this time $24.99. This is a rip-off! I HAD TO PAY TWICE!! $39.99 the first time and then $24.99 the second time | 45002412|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|533
2 | Problems and Failings of Turbo Tax 2014 I've been a Turbo Tax user for 11 years, and until this year, it's been great. This year (2014) was was a deep disapointment. The primary difficultly was that the importation of the previous year's return. Although the import seemed to occur correctly, and did bring in some of the textual information correctly, it brought in completely wrong numeric information. For example, the previous year's state tax refund was off by a factor of 100. My Roth Basis tracking has disappeared, previous year's donation carryover's dissapeared. Etc. I pointed TurboTax to all the previous years returns, locted in the TurboTax directory, and imported them, but all to no avail.

1 | Extra Fees I have used Turbotax online edition for the past 10 years with ease. This year was by far the worst experience I've had with them. In the past the site walked me through quickly and it was quite easy to get my federal taxes filed with e-file for free. When I first started to enter in my information it wouldn't allow me to choose the head of household filing status. Finally they fixed this bug and I could finish where I left off 2 months later. Then, they "required" me to upgrade to the deluxe version because I got a 1099-MISC for a one time coaching stipend I received for measly $1,000. This deluxe upgrade cost me $55 AND didn't even include my state! At least the deluxe version software you can purchase in the stores include the state e-filing! This way would have cost me about $100. Instead I went to the CalFile and e-filed for free. I'm very disappointed in Turbotax online this year. I don't know if I will continue to use them next year. The convenience isn't worth the extra fees to me. Extra fees and required "upgrades" | 45002361|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|537

1 | State Return questions I live in Tennessee and do not have to file a state return. Turbo tax should recognize that residents of the Great State of Tennessee do not have to file a state tax return 99.999999% of the time and therefore Turbo tax should not ask me if i'm sure that i don't want to efile my state return. The state return check box should not be selected by default when efiling for Tennessee residents. by default Turbo Tax should recognize that 99.9999% of Tennessee residents DO NOT have to file a state return.

2 | E file great - Hidden Charges not so Great? When it came to filing my returns , I had to purchase another
e file for the second state return for 42.00 which I feel was excessive and un fair. Secondly, when i filed the returns the
addtional purchase for the second state did not get recorded or
I did not get credit. I had to pay for both states twice.

This is wrong and I hope some responds to my email with a
explanation.

3 | Disappointed I was pleased with explanation of the tax questions and the ease of getting my refund back.
But. . . It was difficult to log in due to disabled email accounts (Almost an hour). It lacked editing sections that has been easier. It lacked full disclosure of costs until the end. these are easily fixed. I did not get an option to print. My filing cost increased substantially over previous years, and I will be looking for other alternatives if they are not corrected.

1 | Non plused This version is certainly a significant step back from the turbo tax I have been used to. I doubt I will use this again next year. The application stalled and was slow proceeding from one tax block to another. It did not have the nice logical flow and prompts I'm used to and that made it easier to fill in. It's not intuitive and the window helps would often cause the application to minimize and I'd have to pull it up again. It was not me it kept happening over and over. Going back to re-check completed blocks or edit was difficult, not easy navigating back like before. Had to redo stuff several times. I've been loyal and found incredible value in turbo tax for years but as I reflected I think this edition was sloppy and quality was severely compromised and showed even in appearance. Looked cheap! I doubt turbo tax will come back under current leader, he was trying to monetize and didn't include required forms on the deluxe versions for crying out loud. Unless there's a DRASTIC redo and they talk to users to improve the app I'm done. they have lost the lead Slow kept stalling, has lost a "flow" and easy feel, doesn't appear as"smart" as 2 and 3 versions ago, kept breaking off | 45002333|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|545

2 | 2014 TurboTax has very calculatedly and underhandedly nickel & dimed me this year so that I am paying considerably more for the same services. This is surprisingly deceitful on the part of Intuit, and I will find other tax assistance for 2015. Incremental costs relative to last year are a deal breaker | 45002328|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|547
3 | Got a refund, some software glitches I am a longtime user of TurboTax for around 10 years. This year was a difficult experience filing. The software would tell me that if I wanted to go back and explore certain options on my own, to go to that section and click on explore on my own, except when I would do that, that option did not appear. I had to prepare my return twice because of this.
Also, at the start of tax season, there were some very confusing messages from TurboTax about certain unforeseen difficulties the company had with this year's returns, stating that people could get a refund for the purchase of TurboTax. The messages were multiple and confusing. I ultimately did not seek said refund.
Also, while preparing my return, TurboTax said that the form for itemized deductions was not available, but I could continue to file anyway without the form. Seriously?! In the end, I guess it showed up, because on the second return I prepared, that alert did not come up.
TurboTax was always my "go-to" for my tax preparation. After this year, I am not so sure. A friend of mine used H&R Block's software and said it was easy, free too. I may just have to try that next year. Too many in-house ads and some difficulties w/software | 45002319|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|548

2 | Filed with lots of questions and crossed fingers. Towards the end where it was doing the final check (Smart Check) of the Federal form, it kept popping up with these form questions. There was a small window in the middle of the page to try to see what it was asking for on the form. The questions that it was asking for for form inputs were not clear and understandable. It was very frustrating. I may end up using a tax service next year. Gets real confusing quickly. | 45002302|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|550

2 | Worked, but left something to be desired Overall, this program seemed to work well and had a lot of nice features.

I"m feeling disappointed in a few things though.
1) I am using the Premier version as i have to file 3 states for various rental properties in addition to my personal taxes. I appreciate TurboTax asking a lot of questions, but eventually you answer them all and are trying to just submit your taxes and you realize they continue to find errors, or think of new things to ask you, and suddenly the submission process took an additional hour or more. I'm sure it is a fine line between asking too many questions and not enough, but i definitely felt like they asked too many and made this too complex.

2) I was shocked to find that the price per state return (after the 1 "free" included one) is $39.99. This seems ridiculous, but i was considering paying it just to be done, even though my state returns are extremely simple compared to my federal. I thought I'd do a quick google search and found 100's of people that were complaining about shady practices for TurboTax. It seems that in addition to paying for the state, you have to pay additional money to efile for the state. That was another $25. So, each state (beyond your 1 "free" one), will cost you about $65. Ridiculous.

3) I personally used the feature where you can sign into your stock/brockerage/whatever accounts and have the forms autmatically pulled/populated for you. This seemed clunkly at first, but acceptable. Later on, however, i found that the forms that were pulled didn't have the data pulled in entirety, and i ended up with around 60 "corrections" that had to be made before submitting my taxes. This was unexpected and resulted in more than an hour of cleanup work just for something simple that TT had imported itself. I eventually deleted all that had been imported and manually typed it in.

My normal tax professional historically charges me $460 for 2 federal, and 3 state returns, and she does the work in an hour. I"ve spent somewhere in the neighborhood of 6-10 hours, and it has cost me (if i had done all the state filing and efiling) about $215. Also, as thorough as the software seems, I had a few issues with things like the child credit that i do not believe it filled out properly and i believe i left some money on the table (in the governments pockets?) .

In conclusion, if you are doing really simple taxes like 1040-ez, this is likely good for you. If you are doing something more complex, find yourself a good tax professional and consider using them for your own sanity. Auto-populate only partially worked, misleading cost of state filing, took forever | 45002296|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|552
1 |  i've used your product for 7 years, never had any problems untill this year. spent 4 hours getting to the point where i find that i don't get my state return free,"as advertized", seems that offer is only good to feb 15. then why does your deluxe edition adversize one free state return? and it does not say that offer ends at any time!!!! cost me $54.95, and i fill that you owe me that back because i would have never choose the deluxe if i'ld known i had to pay for fed and state. iwould of got thr free fed, and payed for the state. now because i waited thinking turbo tax was great and i'ld get done in plenty of time,i'm late on my state return and will have to pay a late fee and a pentilty. never use again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  | 45002270|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|553
3 | Maybe time for a change? After 9 years, it's time for a change. Each year the price goes up and the number of features goes down forcing you into the more expensive version.

1 | Save your money; Do it with pencil and paper The interview/Q&A process for the federal return is fairly straight-forward, although it takes much longer than doing it by hand with pencil and paper on the IRS forms.

However the state interview/Q&A process is absolutely worthless, at least for the three states I've tried (CA, AZ, and KS). The help and information provided throughout the state process are either nonexistent or worthless (the comments and "help" if there is any, basically just restates what's already on the screen in the prompt.) There's no explanation, nor even the help info and instructions provided on the state forms and instructions themselves. They should at least provide those in PDF format for easy reference.

1 | Last year I'm using this product I've been using this product since the 90s an I can honestly say that while the price keeps going up, these past three years the quality has been going down. This year I wasn't even prompted for last year's estimated tax payments so guess what - I missed it. Now I'll have to take extra notes and remember to apply my 2014 overpayment to my 2015 taxes. The "wizard" is no longer present in this software. This is officially the final year I'll be using it. Glosses over VERY important steps like applying your last year's estimated payments. Watch out!

3 | Got 'er done! I pretty much know what I'm doing, but for some reason feel the need to click thru every step in case I miss something that is new this year. The click thru is slow and annoying.

Plus...I understand that you are making the program more and more easy so everyone can use it, but the "dumbing" down is getting rather annoying. Perhaps that's my fault due to forcing myself to click thru everything.

All in all, thanks for making this program. I've used it for who knows how long 15 years or so, I guess. :-) The constant click thru | 45002251|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|559

1 | Lots of hidden fees They charge you to purchase TurboTax, a fee for upgrading to TurboTax Premier if you have *any* reason to file a 1040 (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc), a fee for your state return, a fee to *file* you state return online.

All these fees are not advertised and are presented *after* you painstakingly work through their mediocre software, thus committing yourself to using their service and paying their fees.

1 | Easy... unless On the whole, Intuit provides a well rounded and easy to use product. I have used Intuit's software for the better part of a decade and find it to have consistent quality and have noticed some minor improvements through the years.

That said, there are a few areas that cause me to give an overall poor score.

1) The software and interview questions are well thought out and easy to follow but if you have trouble finding a specific topic or question, finding it and navigating to it can be challenging (for example, unreimbursed mileage is not easily accessible and is overly cumbersome).

2) Intuit's changes to the pricing model were confusing to say the least. As consumers, we would expect a product to maintain or improve its quality and prices should remain the same or decrease. Intuit has chosen to alienate its current customers to maximize its short-term profits due to product differentiation and lock-in and is not rewarding loyalty.

3) Probably the single biggest factor causing me to rate an otherwise good product with a poor score is Intuit's blatant dishonesty in pricing. When you select a product and are required to upgrade to get additional functionality, according to Intuit's website, you need to pay the difference between the prices for the upgrade. However, when you try to make the upgrade, Intuit charges an amount greater than the difference between the prices. Specifically, based on the prices posted on Intuit's website, there is a $25 difference between the Deluxe and Premier product, but an upgrade costs $30 plus tax. There is no easy or direct way to address this, so you simply must pay the additional amount despite Intuit saying it should not be that amount. Taking the time to find someone to charge you the right amount costs more than the difference in the prices. That is simply wrong and if it is not an honest error is actual an act of fraud. Considering we are expected to entrust Intuit with hour tax filing and trusting them to carefully check our returns for accuracy and to navigate the complicated tax laws, a simple oversight in how they charge for an upgrade seems unlikely and makes me wonder if they can be trusted to gather our information and report it correctly in the tax filing process. If we are to trust Intuit to be accurate in the details, then perhaps this was not an honest mistake at all and was an intentionally misleading and fraudulent decision.

3 | Not As Easy As The CD! Most difficult when attempting to pay Federal and State taxes; timed out when paying taxes and had to begin the process again. That is when I had to contact Technical Support and Customer Service to walk me through the process to complete filing. It is more difficult filing online than when I did with the CD. | 45002143|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|575
3 | updates were not working I waited until the last minute, of course, to file my return. When I tried to download Turbotax to my PC, it stalled on "Preparing to install" for 5 or so minutes before failing. My more modern Mac allowed me to install, but wanted to update. Every time I tried the update, I ran into an error and Turbotax wouldn't open. I tried all the workarounds suggested on help forums, but to no avail.

On the bright side, after waiting on hold for a long time, I did get through to a customer service rep at Turbotax, and he pushed me a version of Turbotax that worked. I was able to get my taxes done with one hour to spare. couldn't download Turbotax to PC or mac without help | 45002123|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|576

3 | Got the job done I went to pay for my state taxes to be filed with my refund and once I scrolled down, I saw that I was being charged almost $60 rather than the $29 fee. I clicked back and saw that they elected me to pay "plus" against my consent. I understand that they make money off of adding additional incentives but this took it beyond what was comfortable. I've used TurboTax for the past 5 years but this may be my last. Felt a little scammy this year. | 45002091|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|581
3 | Hidden Fee I understand paying $50.00 to have your taxes done as thoroughly as they do, but I don't understand having to pay an additional $39.95 for them to use a bank to disperse your funds into your account with no mention of this at the beginning, middle or even near the end of the process. They wait until the very end, which sucked. Otherwise you have the option to disagree with this fee and print it out instead and mail it in to the IRS yourself. Well, that's fine if you have a printer...but ...would if you don't? I also find it interesting that when you use the free filing option on Turbo Tax you don't have that fee of $39.95...hmmm. I know this because I filed my son's return for free with Turbo Tax at no charge and had it deposited straight into the same account as I did ours, Now that is awesome for him. Not so much for us...just doesn't make sense. We are the ones paying for the service and then have to pay even more to get our money. Even if you pay for the service by Credit Card you have to pay that fee of $39.95. Wow, Well, I think they need to disclose the extra fee right up front along side of the cost to use Turbo Tax. I found this deceitful as well as discouraging. Not sure I will go this process again next year. It is common knowledge that we all like to know costs up front. I considered this to be a hidden cost. So be aware! As you would and will not know this until you are finished and ready to pay for the cost of the service he very end. Hidden Cost | 45002089|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|582

1 | Disappointing this year Since they pulled that stunt of removing schedule C and jacking up the price to get it back ... then only relenting when there was an outcry ... just makes me very wary of using Intuit products. (I already stopped using Quicken when they insisted on frequent upgrades.) They also make it very hard to fill in the bank routing info on the state return if you want to mail it and avoid the e-file fee. This is all symptomatic of a company that has moved away from valuing its customers toward an attitude of arrogance instead. took out schedule C and fixed it too late | 45002056|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|584
1 | Bait'n'Switch The advertising indicated Fed and 3 state e-returns if I get the Deluxe Edition. Any extra states $19.99. When done with Fed and 1st State, Program wanted to charge $39.99 for a 2nd e-file state. Called Customer Service and was told I could not do an e-file 2nd state without paying, but reduced it to $19.99. I was irritated, but wanted to file all online. When I finally finished the returns the program wanted to charge me an additional $24..99 per state to actually e-file my returns. How do you get away with this? It should be criminal. I filed all returns by mail. Say one thing and once paid, keep charging to finish. | 45002039|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|585

Turbo Tax is a great product, but this is your Super Bowl 4/15

Undependable when you need them most!!! You better hope someone else doesn't offer your exact service. I've been a customer over 10 yrs, and I was more than Very Disappointed.
A very courteous C/S agent helped me in the end. His name was Kelly. I can't believe the anguish he must have taken tonight, but he was very empathetic and calm.

3 | Continuity Turbo Tax is fairly easy to use, but when your personal income is derived from an S Corporation, it becomes much more complex.

I purchased the TurboTax Business, to file my S Corp. taxes, then I had to go out again and purchase another TT program from my 1040 Personal filing. It took at least a half an hour on hold to TT, before a very nice, knowledgeable, and helpful lady answered (understandable because it was April 14th). After going over all my info, it was determined that the only thing I really needed from my biz filing was my K-1 form. Thus she recommended I use TT Deluxe, which included this ability.

When I went back to my account, and selected Deluxe ($59.99), it ran me through everything I needed to do my taxes, but I had to manually enter my K-1 info, because it was unable to retrieve it.

When I was finally done and ready to file, I discovered that TT was actually charging me $104.00 for TT Home and Biz, rather than TT Deluxe like I had selected. They did this without explanation.

I was in a hurry so I paid what they asked, but I will be calling them after filing season and bringing this to their attention. It will be interesting to see how they respond.

I know that S corp filings are a bit complex, but when TT sees that there is only one shareholder listed, it would be great if they offered seamless continuity...or even if there is more than one share holder. The idea is to store and track biz filing...especially Form K-1...and/or allow storage of K-1 at a site TT can recognize and access, then make it easy for the filer to do his/her personal returns by recommending the precise package for it, and offer a discounted payment option right then and there, that would allow them to go straight to their 1040 filing, would import all pertinent K-1 data automatically, and then walk them through the entire process. Charged me for wrong package. Needs continuity between biz and personal | 45001982|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|588
1 | Overcharged and unsaved data I filed my taxes on turbotax at the end of March and I hit the SAVE button before logging out. This was after I entered all my information, up to the Healthcare section -- I had to stop there to call my insurance company the next day to see when my insurance started. After getting this information, I logged onto my turbotax account, and everything that I did was no longer there. Just gone. I spend at least an hour or more sitting in front of my computer and filling out all the forms the previous night. At this initial time, the turbotax prep fee was $27.99, but when I went back this past week it hiked up to a whopping $50 something... WHAT!? Thanks to the sudden hike in your charge, I ended up paying over $90 just for the prep fee. The only reason why I had to REDO it later is because turbotax failed to save my data despite the fact that I clicked the save button multiple times....

I want a refund. This is absolutely ridiculous.I have used TurboTax for mutiple years now,but this time around I feel cheated and taken advantage of. Will not be returning to Turbotax next year if this is how they treat their customers. Time for me to switch to H&R block. didn't save my tax return. sudden overcharge and hike up in their cost. | 45001972|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|589
3 | The good and the bad I had so much trouble finding a telephone # to even get any support. I did not appreciate filing an incident report JUST to get a stupid telephone support number. It sure felt like Turbo Tax does not want to take telephone calls. Then when you get one you have to wait an hour to get a call back. And heaven forbid if you don't get that call back answered on their first try because they won't call you back. You get to call back and start over. But by the time you get the call back, you're no longer in front of your computer and are in a car so you really don't get any answers then because you don't have information in front of you anymore. Even in my business, I attempt to call a customer 3 times before I just leave a message.

Second, I did not checkmark giving to the Presidential election fund but at the very end when I am done to print out a review, lo and behold, it is checked off that I want to give. So I search the online help, and find where to uncheck it. But...if you do that, it says it will have to amend your tax papers and you can't e-file if you do that. Even though I didn't submit the e-file yet, it said that. So then I was too paranoid to correct it for fear of missing the deadline. So we wound up giving $6 away that I didn't want to give.

The price. I had to pay $55 more dollars than last year because I am self-employed. I definitely did not feel that I got that much increase in the product to justify that huge increase in price. After this year's experience (we've used this for years), I am seriously thinking I'm either hiring someone else to do it, or trying another software.

The good was that I was familiar with the product so it didn't feel as daunting since I could bring stuff over from last year for comparisons, addresses, etc.

The e-filing is nice.

Ok that's all folks... Difficult to get # & phone support. Online help so-so. Having to give to pres fund. Huge price increase for same prod. | 45001969|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|590
3 | Well, darn it I owe ALOT!! I owe a lot this year due to an accounting error. I need to split my payment up some from bank account and some from credit card. Cant do that with this program, soo its a problem. Turbo Tax should allow multiple ways of paying with electronic cards. Would have been nice to put multiple accounts in to add up to the total amount due. I could have had everything done and paid for electronically in just a few minutes. Oh well.... haven't snail mailed anything in over a year... I wonder if I have any stamps. I needed to use more than one credit card to pay this year.

I've used them for years but will no longer after this ordeal..... ever.... again. BullSh#t when you try to downgrade and transfer ino | 45001902|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|598
3 | Mobile App - ehhh, not so much. I've been a Turbotax user for years. Tax season meant a trip to OfficeMax to buy the boxed software. A few years ago I switched to the online version, which worked very well for me. This year, yet another change - I tried the mobile app. No complaints whatsoever about entering my financial info - it worked quite well and was easy and intuitive.

So, I'm ready to submit... paying with my iTunes account??? Are you serious??? I don't trust those Apple clowns with my credit card!!! So, there must be an easy way to switch my payment preference to a credit card, right? Sure, just select the Print Center from the My Account drop down in the upper left. Conveniently, this works in a browser but despite clicking every possible option in the Mobile App... nothing. Sigh. Alas, I had to revert to the browser version to complete my filing process.

Now, one more gripe. Why is the credit card option buried under Print Center? I don't actually want to destroy a forest and print the ream of paper worth of my return (hence the mobile app and e-filing?). Why would Print Center be the obvious place to look for credit card options???

Intuit, I'd rate your Mobile App 5 stars, except for the payment issue, which brings it down to a 3 star. I spent more time searching for the credit card option than I did generating my entire return. It's 2015. Time to improve your mobile app. Unable to pay TurboTax fee with credit card from iPad- had to login from good old fashioned computer/browser :( | 45001883|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|599

Although convenient, I was charged $39.99 for extra services without anyway to determine what it was for with time running out I attempted to contact the customer service # listed and number didn't include a 1 before number given. when this was determined after much time the number then said to call back when open. NOT open on April 15 Really! with no other option I agreed to the charges as time was at hand. I had already had to upgrade my service twice then was charged more that was unclear. I will continue to attempt to contact turbotax tomorrow and expect to find some satisfaction or I will devote my life to spreading the word of what a questionable operation I have experience you to be. charged $39.99 without explaination | 45001863|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|600

3 | I Miss The Old TurboTax There is a lot to like in TurboTax Home & Business 2014.

It automatically detects last year's TurboTax file on my computer and imports my name, spouse's name, our SSNs, our address, occupations, W2, and 1099 information from last year. This helps a lot as it (a) saves typing and (b) increases accuracy.

After I complete entries for this year, TurboTax offers a detailed, side-by-side comparison of my return from last year and my return from this year. Additionally, it provides a side-by-side, 5-year tax history that highlights 24 major entries on returns for the current year and the past 4 years. Though not as detailed as the 2-year comparison mentioned earlier, there is sufficient detail that I can spot trends when they are present.

Save to PDF is a wonderful feature. Though I will probably never need them, I have PDFs for the current year and the past 12 years. The PDFs are of everything: tax returns, all worksheets, eFile electronic postmark, W-2s, and more. All of those files, along with their corresponding TurboTax files and supporting PDFs from banks, employers, and others occupy only 32 MB of space on my computer and I saved copies of all of these in 2 or 3 safe places in case my hard drive fails.

Despite using TurboTax for many years, I am frustrated by its cost, which seems to rise every year. I am, also, frustrated by the number of versions, how similar all of the packages look, and how poorly the packages (and the website) describe the pros and cons of each version. Both the packages and the website contain ambiguous, color-coded checkboxes that are arranged in columns next to generic, nebuous terms stripped of all meaning. Most years, I wait for the reviews to figure which version to buy.

Once I make a decision and go to the store to buy TurboTax, store personnel (who must go into a back room to get the software because only empty boxes are kept on store shelves) bring me the wrong box then argue with me about what I am buying. I have learned to walk into the store with the SKU code for the product that I need so that I get the correct item. Some years, it seems like I spend more time reading the reviews and obtaining the SKU code than I do using the software after I purchase it.

In summary, there is a lot to like about the TurboTax product and a lot to hate about the way that TurboTax (actually, Intuit, the makers of TurboTax) treats me. If the other major vendor of tax software were to assure me that they could import all of my past TurboTax files with their software, I would switch to the competitor in a minute. I won't mention the name of the competitor as I don't want my review to be deleted for having mentioned another brand name. Suffice it to say that there is competition out there that I think merits consideration. Until the competition can import my TurboTax files from years past, I will keep paying too much money for, and working too hard to purchase, TurboTax.

1 | Major Non-Resident State Issues I have used TacAct the last 3 years. I used to use Turbotax, but it was getting too expensive, so I switched. This year I switched back to Turbotax because my broker imports all my stock trades and other info automatically, so I decided to pay the premium turbotax fees.

Federal was Ok. I would still like to see a simpler walk through. It seemed on many screens it was clear if I needed to click on a topic or if turbo tax was going to take me there anyway. Not impressed with many dumb questions and info that should have been self populated or calculated from other info.

I would recommend creating an app to take pictures of all your forms and it would capture all the info and input it autimatically.

Filing the state taxes things got worse. I sometimes didn't know what was being asked. Or the same info was asked to be input on 2 consecutive pages, where a different layout of question would have been much clearer faster and simpler. It seemed like people who had no knowledge of the individual states created layout and flow of questions.

I live in one state and work in another. Filing one state as nonresident and then getting a credit in my resident state. Wow what a nightmare. At one point Turbotax asked me what portion of my AGI was from my nonresident state. Shouldn't Turbotax know the answer to this. Why do I have to pay $39.95 per state if I have to figure out what is being asked. I had to go to the internet and do research. And even then I wasn't sure it was correct. Taxes are complicated, but that is why I pay Turbotax to make it easy.

I will be using TaxAct next year again. Granted their layout and questions aren't much better, but if I am going to file my taxes possibly incorrect, I can do it their for a 1/3 of the price.

Certainly with all the money being collected, a few people could be hired to review nonresident tax issues and some writers to word questions simple and in layman's terms.

Very frustrated and a little nervous about the accuracy of my state returns. Not sure what was being asked on state. State does not always calculate answers automatically from data given. | 45001849|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|603
3 | Not as good as previoussly The guided steps were easy to follow. However, when specific items came up (e.g. hobby income), it took a long time to get information.
I like the way it used to be set up where you could either go through the guided or fill in the forms individually. I often need to look at the 1040 for specific details, but was not able to do this on the online version this year. finding exact answers and forms, a problem | 45001847|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|604
3 | Fairly smooth sailing Program was easy to use for most part. The "deductions" area could have been a little less confusing though, specifically the education expense area, and the State: homeowner credit area.
Also, the real estate and investments section was removed from the Deluxe version, forcing me to pay extra for the "Premium" version, thereby nullifying my company discount. I will take a serious look at the competition next time! bumped up to higher (expensive) version unsuspectingly! | 45001843|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|605
1 | Brain Dead Stupidity...... I have been filing taxes now since 1967. And, I have been using Turbo Tax for at least 15 years now. Listen because I have something to say here....never, I mean never has my personal taxes been as difficult to do as they are this year. I wanted to take a sludge hammer to both your Turbo tax and my computer. I mean questions, things I have never heard of before, silly questions and repeating the same things over and just dealing with BS that is enough to wanna move to a foreign country is what I think of this tax filing season. You used to be easy. Now, you're not easy, you're actually hard to the point that i wanna just beat my computer to death over......

1 | Wheres the turbo tax? Had to have a Cosco employee help me find the correct software package. Strange, since I've been buying turbo tax for years.
I had trouble with the free upgrade to business. I only make a few hundred on the side.
I had trouble with a free upgrade to premium or something. Neither worked because i needed access to my "account". Even though i typed in the correct password and question answer I was rejected.

2 | Good help if you know nothing about taxes. I have been using Turbo Tax since I filed my first return in the mid nineties. It was always a good program if you had a simple return, fast, cheap, and effective. Now that my returns are getting more complicated, I am lost on some of the questions, they go off tangent and have nothing to do with the input I gave. What should be simple gets confusing. Not only that the cost has skyrocketed in the last couple years. I paid almost $100.00 for the version I needed to use this year. I know tax preparers that cost about that much and understand the tax code in a way that I don't that I'm sure can get me better results. I am considering not using again for that reason. Bottom line if you don't have anything more than a 1040ez Turbo is for you, if not prob good to get a tax preparer for the same money. Confusing at times, cost is way to high. | 45001825|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|608
1 | Unexpected additional fees I didn't appreciate that I was charged and additional $45 for combining my state and federal returns. I had to pay a total of $95. Last year I only paid $40. The "deluxe" didn't even provide me any additional benefits. I ended up paying additional money for no good reason. By the time I got to the end, I wasn't willing to start over BUT I learned that I WON'T be using TurboTax again! For $95 I'd rather pay a real person to do my taxes so I know I'm getting the most out of my return. Overpriced and shady business practices. I'm incredibly disappointed in TurboTax. hidden fees | 45001806|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|609
1 | too many hidden fees & too hard to get a hold rep i bought turbo tax for ~$50
+ additional state $40
+ efile $25
+ they changed the rules so i needed to buy premier to to 1 stock trade $40

i tried calling turbotax 3 times on 3 different days/times and each time it was over a 90 minute wait

for that price, i could have had it done by a professional and saved the time and headache so many hidden fees...probably will go elsewhere next year | 45001801|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|610
1 | no customer support I downloaded Turbo Tax the same as I have done since 2008. after spending my time going through the preparation process, the software would not allow me to file or pay or even find help to resolve the problem. I attempted several times to contact customer support. I was unable to speak to anyone. the automated service hung up on me several times. I was hung up on by the service person 2 times. So I paid for something that did not do what it claimed and then had to return to the website at the last minute and pay again to file through the website. Downloaded turbotax to my computer like I have done since 2008 but THIS time it did not function properly. | 45001791|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|611
1 | NOT HAPPY I have used turbo tax over 10 years and was very displeased with user name & psswd not being enough to login. After I had already completed my taxes and went back in just to e-file I was forced to re-confirm & was unfortunately for me, not using a system that would allow me to access my personal e-mail. This caused me a lot of frustration!!!!! HARD TO ACCESS | 45001790|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|612
1 | SCAM! I opted not to use TurboTaxPLUS for 29.99 only to file my state for 29.99 how ever at the end of the process I was billed an additional 29.99 for TTPLUS even though i declined in the beginning. they automatically charge you for TurboTaxPLUS | 45001773|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|613

1 | Paid for e-file, but forced to mail it in I used TurboTax Premier for the 2014 tax year instead of deluxe like in 2013.

This year my tax situation was simpler than last, but for what ever reason I was rejected half a dozen times with the following error "E-file rejection errors IND-031-01 or IND-032-01: The e-filing PIN or prior year AGI does not match"

The pin and AGI were correct (checked multiple times and went to the IRS site to verify both my AGI and my wifes).

In the end I had to print out 48 pages and pay for postage in addition to the fees to Audit Defense and efile.

I'm very disappointed with TurboTax after more than a decade of using the product. no matter what I tried my file was rejected | 45001767|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|615

1 | Disappointed in 2015 I have been a faithful user of the TurboTax for years, and despite my less than satisfactory experience this year, will probably remain a customer. However, I am very disappointed in this year's experience.

First off, when I searched for help, I did not get professional advice; it was mostly other users offering shortcuts or additional information. The couple of times when it looked like standard help from the TurboTax itself, I could not find the trail they were suggesting (ex: go to Business Tab... what Business Tab, where is the Business Tab?).

I have been using TT for over a decade, more even, and I have never had a situation when I needed to contact their technical support until today, but alas, I could not figure out how to contact hem. I will now have to amend my return at a later date, when I figure out how to fix the errors. Meanwhile, I did not get all of the refund due to me, and now I don't know how I will get my money back for paying taxes I didn't owe in the first place. cumbersome interface; unclear options; hard to edit | 45001754|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|618

2 | Overcharged I think I paid for the deluxe I know I signed up to automatically receive each years turbo tax. You billed me in November 2014, and now I had to pay for state filing. And if Federal is free why am I paying 59.99? I'll have to go back on my bank statements and confirm this. But I think I've been overcharged in 13 and again in 14.

1 |  Nice offer to start out "free" but not even a third of the way in a "pop-up" suggested that based on my entries I needed to upgrade and then to add the state it was yet another charge that was not identified in the beginning. So what started out as FREE ended up being $100.00 by the time I was done. Plus the site was not as user friendly as others I have tried. Will not be a returning customer.  | 45001726|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|624
2 | Slightly Irritated I am extremely frustrated with this site because I was charged for the Plus option that I did not want. I emailed the person the website told me to, and I got an automated message back that said she was "out of the office." What the heck?? Ugh. Although this site was easy to use, the horrible customer service and unnecessary fees made it to where I dont want to use this site in the future.  | 45001723|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|625

Then, when i went to check out, they charged me an additional 30$, after claiming to be FREE, and there was no other option to re-file for free with the site, i checked. So in short, turbotax has false advertising and if they are going to charge they should have stated so from the beginning. Not using the site again, turbotax disappointed me this time. charged me when claimed to be free | 45001708|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|630

I made the contributions as deductions from my paycheck. I tried at least 6 times to correct this. I had to go ahead and file the return by the deadline and thus overpay my taxes. Now I will need to file an amended return and I will not use Turbo Tax.
I expect someone to review this return and make a response. The HSA questions did not produce a deduction from income. | 45001704|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|632

It tried to get me to perform a state return for my state Florida, where we don't have personal income taxes for Florida and it kept asking me over and over. Exasperating !!

Our son had the same problems and we as well as him will never again trust your come on to use your Tax Return Program. This was a complete lie to your customers and stealing money that we do not have since we owe anyway. It is a form of frond and deceit on your part. I am very sorry that I spent $50 to use this and than am being charged extra for filing after reading your instructions that we would not be charged. Please try to make things right and reimburse those of us that fell for your deceitful representation. Thank you for your time in dealing with this crime. Robert A.

1 | Premium Service I bought the turbotax Premier at Costco. for about $50 said it included state, apparently that doesn't mean they'll e-file state as part of the $50 plus I automatically wants to upgrade me to Premium service for another $40 so basically its $65 to file state my return for state is $113 so over half gone to turbotax. so grand total $115 to e-file my taxes.

The form would not let me double click on the required box and the software would not allow me to go to the actual form to fill it out manually. This kept me from being able to file my federal AND State taxes on time. I filed for a federal extension but the webpage would not let me go any further to file my state taxes. Customer service was unable to identify the problem and I was unable to file state taxes on time. Also note the misspelling of "clink" instead of click...sloppy code, sloppy copy editing.

3 | Not as good as last year. Still a vast improvement over doing everything by hand. User friendly. Has good feel.
It took me ten or twelve tries to get e-file to work. This is the SSL bug.
The $40 price for business software, the $40 for an extra state, and the $25 for e-filing state pushes the cost to where hiring an accountant becomes a reasonable alternative.
The review fails to specify what the corrections are for. It is opaque, frustrating, and only marginally useful. Transmission bug. High cost of add ons. The review feature is terrible. | 45001654|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|639
3 | Only the thinigs I did not like 1. The program did not prompt or instruct me how to save my work to restart it later -- continue entering information, to or to change something I had entered, or add something I was not sure of during the entry process.
2. There was not option or instruction to re-enter the program and choose to file electronically, after I said I do not want to file electronically on the first prompt (because I have some items I need to edit before filing).
3. When I answered "No" to the question about child care expenses, the program responded "Great, you will save because of your child care expenses." It incorrectly prepared form 2441 with an odd amount of $9.
4. Did not give me the option to apply any of my tax refund forward to tax year 2015. Missing prompts, and apparent errors | 45001641|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|640
2 | Versions dumbed down and must purchase Premier now Let's see if Intuit deems my review to include "inappropriate attitude"! Seriously, you're only allowed to have your review posted if you pass some editorial standard that remains veiled in secrecy! Hope it's not the F*x News crew doing the editing...

I've been using TurboTax since 1993. That's right, for more than 20 years.

First of all, I'm pretty p*ssed off about having to purchase the Premier version this year #around $100 MSRP# just so I could fill out a Schedule C for small business income.

I've been able to do this for years using the Deluxe edition, usually paying no more than around $60 for it, and this year, "Tough luck, partner. You know you need the Schedule C so you'll pay the extra money for Premier, you'll smile about it, and you'll please now shut up and quit whining. In fact, we at Intuit had many meetings about this very topic and it works out best for our bonus plan if we make this change! Like I said, tough luck, ch*mp!"

And it's only because I read about the change in the press that I didn't buy the Deluxe version only to have to stand in line trying to return it after I had opened the CD, installed it the software, and found out at the last minute that I couldn't complete my tax return!

Seriously, you think a clerk at Walmart is going to believe that "No, I really didn't use it even though I opened it, see, because it wouldn't allow me to do this thing called a Schedule C..."

Classy, Intuit. Notice how I refrained from prof*nity here..

Further, with each passing year, the amount of helpful information available to a tax filer from within the program is diminishing, and this year, every time I clicked on "Learn More", it was like "D*ng it, you ask too many questions. If you don't understand our very high level explanation, it OBVIOUSLY doesn't apply to you!"

Does this sound vaguely familiar?:
"The first thing you need to know is that this deduction is extremely hard to qualify for, because your qualified expenses must exceed 2% of your Adjusted Gross Income #AGI..."

Personally, I'd have opted to put this dire warning into the medical expenses "Learn More" verbiage, where my expenses must exceed NOT a measly 2%, but a whopping 10%, yes 10% of my #AGI. Just sayin'.

Soooooo much less helpful than it used to be.

I can imagine calling customer service with this remark and hearing, "What, you want us to keep including in the product the I.R.S. forms you might need to consult? Whaddaya think the I.R.S. web site is for? Well?!!!"

No offense, but it would undoubtedly be delivered in an offsh*re accent, too. Maybe I should say, "No offence".

At any rate, gone are the days when I had immense confidence in the "interview process", or what they now call "walk me through it".

I must have answered maybe six questions beyond importing last year's return before I had to resort to "You have got to be kidding me, it would be faster to just do it myself" mode.

You know, where you give up on the interview because you're being asked an irrelevant question which you don't know how to answer, and yet the "wizard' simply won't let you past this page.

Which software should I use next year, peeps? I am truly open to your responses...

BTdubs, this "Submit a Review of TurboTax" page does not load properly in Firefox, and only works in Internet Explorer. Just sat there at "Loading..." in Firefox. HTML5? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?

BT Double Dubs, Though it might not seem it, I'm the kind of guy who will seek out the manager at an IHOP when I get something just a little North of mediocre, half-hearted service, to COMPLIMENT my server to the manager in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, my remark might make a difference... Drives my wife nuts, of course, but hey, even she would agree that I'm not a sour puss. I have been charitable in my criticism. Feel free to contact me for a software as a service product development and management consulting gig. I can give you over 500 IQ points worth of service in just three people.

2 | Forced Into Paying Extra After having file rejected for something simple, I then had to spend the next half hour trying to convince the site that i didn't want to pay for PLUS service.

Because of just now finding out they were rejected, I didn't have any more time and just went with the PLUS service because no other option would present itself.

Feel like i've been cheated. If you have to go back and refile, you will be tossed around for a while | 45001618|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|642

2 | Review This is the last year I will be using TurboTax. I can go to other sites and get actual FREE e-filing done that includes my 401K and IRA/Roth information. $60 to do my taxes this year and it's the same information as last year. Thanks, but no thanks. I imagine you won't be offering free filing next year. I can take my taxes to your competitors and talk to a live person and ask questions for about as much as you wanted from me AND they file my state taxes for free. Ridiculous. I know you need to make money, but I think I am done here. Thanks for all the really good previous years. God help you if you have a 401K or an IRA/Roth. You want to charge me $60 for that. | 45001601|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|645

1 | 2x data entry, fields don't respond, FRUSTRATING!! My penultimate frustration was TT's reference to the wrong number or field in several cases, combined with deductions in Schedule E being ADDED rather than subtracted!! This wasn't unique. And the HELP pop-ups were worthless! often having nothing to do with the query.
But the ultimate frustration, what took most of the 15th to try, regrettably unsuccessfully, to file MFS in PA for my wife while I live in VA and we filed MFJ fed. TT's solution is to build dummy returns (time consuming and... come on, you can't programme this????) I tried another work-around, which also failed so I'll be mailing the PA return a day late, and definitely a dollar short. I mean, they took my money for the PA return, THEN informed me that it still won't work!
And, uh, WHY? Why can't a state return be filed electronically after the fed has been filed, since I had to dummy-up the state in a separate file?
I had a similar problem last year; I just thought, hoped, they'd have made some improvements, but the little incompatibilities seemed worse also.
It could definitely be more user friendly.
Definitely looking for a better programme for next year. have to re-enter data; wrong data transfers; adds vs subtracts,...on & on... | 45001595|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|647

Paid to download our state program (even though other states are "free") because of my student's income from two states, only to be hijacked into paying again to file both states' returns. I thought your product included filing once it was purchased. Am I missing something?? I will be contacting customer service and the BBB as I feel this is a deceptive practice.

3 | 2014 premier Have loved TurboTax for years- makes me feel like a professional! This year I didn't feel that the carryover information was as seamless as in years past. I felt like I had to enter information that previously would have been automatic, and that there was a lack of recognition regarding some of my assets. I am by no means an expert, just giving my 2 cents.  | 45001573|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|652
2 | payment Originally was going to pay for efiling of state taxes by using federal refund, but because I didn't have easy access to my bank's routing number I had to go back and change the payment to credit card. I evidently didn't notice that the charge for an ugraded account was preselected until I printed my receipt. So now I have paid an extra $40 for an upgraded account for a student that only made $2000 last year. Instead of just the $29 state filing fee. deceiving | 45001550|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|653

1 | Last 10 years Good, this year HSA filed wrong! My HSA contributes got all assigned as taxable income on my return - I will need to file an amended return to fix this. It kind of defeats the point of an HSA if it is all taxable income!

In years past, I'd rate them 5 out of 5, this year I was surprised to find that the HSA information raised my taxes - that is just wrong. In reviewing the forms everything ended up adding to my income, and there wasn't any of it that was shown as tax free. It should have all been as 100% of my HSA went for medical expenses.

The website said that as of 4 hours before the filing date they still had not fixed either the web or the desktop version.

And they raised their price this year! Yeah, fine, but write me a check for the $400 I lost by your screwing up, or refile it for me.

Waiting to hear about a fix.

3 | plus I really liked it it was easy and did not take so long. But I am upset because I said no to turbo plus multiple times and it took out the extra 29.99 plus what I had to pay for my state. I had to let it go because today is the last day and i just made it and I didnt want to take any chances but all the different times you asked I may have said yes and not noticed because of the wording. I feel that is deceiving. and 60 dollars is a lot to me.

1 | Would not let me take proper deductions The program would not let me fill out anything for the Earned Income Credit unless I used the overide for the lines to manually imput it and then it refused to let me e-file. As I pulled up the section to fill it out using the programs guidance it told me i was quailifed, but refused to let me fill anything out and was not even given the option to.

over all expirence was good until the program was under the belief that it was far more intelligent than I, and still could not follow basic tax law instructions.

I've used turbo tax for 15 years, and this will be my last year that I will use this program. poor deduction management | 45001466|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|669
3 | Feeling iffy this year Turbo Tax was simple to use this year - as it has always been. However, as a family with very limited income, the basic free package has changed and the 1040 was not included. I constantly had the popup to upgrade to the $59 product. NOT AFFORDABLE for me. That was VERY disappointing. Really nothing changed for me, there was nothing special about my taxes this year, but I don't have a good comfortable feeling that it was correct. COST! | 45001453|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|670
1 | big bugs in this year's TurboTax for Mac I didn't realize until reviewing our return ready to e-file that several items did not transfer properly from our 2013 return. Assets added to the depreciation list in 2013, our loss carry-overs, and therefore all of the history for 2013 was wrong. To try to start again with a new transfer would have cost me several days work, time which I didn't have, so I had to pull up our 2013 return, review and print out many schedules and forms and correct everything on our 2014 worksheets. I really hope I got it all. I don't know if this is a continuation of Intuit not putting as much staffing to the MAC programs or what, but after using Turbo Tax for many years, I was super mad at finding these errors.  | 45001451|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|671
1 | NO HELP, not right State of KY never downloaded - supposed to be free with Home and Business; purchased separately still could not do it. Repeated calls and attempts thru computer from Feb to April 14 were extremely frustrating.

Last time ever to use Turbo Tax and I have been a regular custormer for over 10 years CD sent service or downloaded.

1 | Took me 8:30 hours to file with Turbo Tax Last year I used Turbo Tax with no problem, was easy step by step guidance. This year Turbo Tax changed the program and it was very VERY complicated. At times it will take me back to where I started or to the previous page to then take me back again and again and again like a dead road. Then it will tell me that I need to upgrade when actually I have the easiest filing form and it can be done FREE. I have a headache and I didn't eat anything the whole day because I was against time April 15.
On top of everything I finished my filing at 12:30 on the 16, which I started at 4 pm on the 15 and I couldn't do my son's filing. Since last year Turbo Tax was so easy I thought I could finish both filings in less than 2 hours, so at 4pm I had more than enough time. The website is soooooooo complicated that I was with Customer Service on the phone from around 8pm to 12:30 am. Extremely dissapointed!

1 | Fees I did not even make that much money and still had to pay an outrageous fee to just submit my tax return. I did not want any extra services such as turbo tax being able to help if I was audited. I was still charge for that fee. I will not use Turbo Tax again due to this. I could delete the extra fee for filing even though it stated 29.99 I was charged 59.99. | 45001422|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|674

1 | Last Year I will use Turbo Tax Turbo Tax took me all day to complete and cost more than going to have someone do a simple federal and state tax return form me. I work in a reciprocal state, and the program wasn't applying taxes I paid in one state to the other state.

2 | Sucked to be PR for my brother! Your tax software online doesn't allow much help for someone who died in early 2015 before their 2014 return was able to be filed. It kept asking me to file a Form 1310 - which is for someone that ISN'T the court-appointed Personal Rep. Took forever to find out I had to file by mail, and I'm disappointed - won't ever use your software again for any kind of estate or representative capacity!

2 | Hidden Charge Overall it was easy to use and free for federal but charges for state which would be fine if it was the 29.99 it said it would be but then it gives you the option to pay with a credit card or take it out of your refund which i opted to take it out of my refund. At the VERY end when you're going to file it tells you how much is being taken out for the charges, it was 60 because it charged me for turbo tax plus which i did not sign up for. I searched this and someone said you can get the charge taken off if you pay by credit card so i went back and paid by credit card and it still charged me for turbo tax plus which I do not want. can't report other income without being issued a form | 45001349|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|684

1 | disappointed Well I've used turbo tax a few years running, but this was the most disappointing. The web site kept throwing error messages that were a hassle to get through. But mostly I felt my taxes were not all that complicated this year, a couple w-2's, a basic 1099 that they charged me a extra 45 for and a few donations. Overall it cost me 85, which I do not own a business, any real estate or any investments. high price, error messages | 45001288|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|691

3 | My Turbo Xperience So, all in all, fairly good experience, but it's still cheaper to go by way of Turbo on the Internet, because this xperience cost approximately $90.

2 | Not Impressed After thinking I was done and ready to file, there was one last check that had me digging into last years return to find answers for all the blanks that needed filled. I was at the last minute anyway (my fault), but those little items caused me to file after midnight. Why weren't these little items found earlier in the process?

Also, I found this online service to be way too expensive. I've used a disc in the past and will go back to it going forward. I HATED that at the end there were bunches of blanks to fill in or I would have to mail it in. It was almost midnight!!! | 45001271|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|694

1 | Product quality significant decline After using Turbo Tax for the last 15 years, this version has left me no choice but to make a change for the future.
1) Don't be deceived by the slick interface, you are paying more for style not substance.
2) The so called change in versions to match there online version was just a smoke screen just to charge more and make it look like they improved the product. I have seen no substantial improvement in the Home & Business version in over 3 years
3) They used to clearly tell you how much they would charge to efile a return and it was reasonable. Now they are getting you both with added product cost and higher filing fees for your state return
4) When you have a complex return with lots of various personal and business deductions and you need to go back to make corrections to specific sections, be prepared for it to be more difficult to and time consuming to do because the software will forget questions you already answered and make you answer them again. This was even after saving it multiple times at multiple points in the data entry process.
5) Finally, the detailed information on what specific types of deductions can and cant be put on each has basically trimmed back so they can charge you more for information they used to normally include in the product. Poor depth of information on most topics | 45001247|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|697
1 | patronized are the unneeded animations, and a back button that jumps all the way to the start of each section truly necessary?

2 | Sneaky I was inadvertently charged for turbo tax plus without my consent as they push it on you so hard that it makes it confusing. Where i thought i was paying for my state tax filing, i was mislead and made to purchase TT plus ALONG with my state filing, although unbeknownst to me. I didn't figure it out until it said i was charged $59.98 which I thought was VERY misleading. Be careful when paying for your state filing that you don't get charged for TT plus. They push it on you so hard and confuse you when you are paying for your state filing. overly pushy to buy the TT Plus, and VERY redundant | 45001195|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|704

IT also picks up items from previous years that are not being used this year. Errors corrected in FED do always get fixed in State.

wait TOO long on for phone help Tax week and previous weeks. I was cutoff the phone line and now way to reach person. I had to start over again.

2. on MA state return entering the 1099-H for family, section was not too clear especially if you switched subscriber (i.e. full year coverage but part with husband and part with wife). Took waay too much time going back and forth to figure a way through. At this price this shouldn't happen!! .

3. Electronic signature was wonky. It would not accept my name (which I know how to spell) saying there was case sensitivity??! I ended up cutting/pasting the name text below my signature block !!

1 | Service was awful! I waited patiently for someone to take my call. When I finally get someone on the line the call instantly drops by no fault of my own or my carrier. So I call back and for whatever reason the system tells me it will have a rep call me back this time. This was never offered as an option the first time, and I have yet to receive a call back from a rep. Though I should not have waited until the last minute, I am still paying $90 and am not receiving ANY service! Furthermore, the system automatically directed me to the more expensive option despite my taxes being the most basic type. I am single, don't have kids, or own property. Why are you directing me to the deluxe package. I am very disappointed with the service I've received (rather lack of) and feel like TurboTax is only out to get my money. waited to speak to person, then call drops and no one calls back! | 45001161|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|709

I was expecting half that, and upon closer inspection, read that I was signed up for the Plus version, instead of the standard 'free' version. Now, I remember DISTINCTLY having declined the upgrade. Twice. Imagine my surprise when I found out that I was paying for it after all. I then started to click the 'back' button until I reached the final page that I would be able to decline the upgrade. Except you can't reach that page once you've gone past a certain point. So I was trapped, having to pay for something I didn't, and don't, need. I don't know where that decline page or button is, so you did a good job of hiding it. But maybe you shouldn't advertise as a 'free' federal return.

There were an inordinate amount of glitches in the software that caused my screen to go blank on numerous occassions.
Finally, upon attempting to eFile my return the application would not submit the return. After numerous redirects to review, which I did on 7-8 occassions. It would not submit the return, though the screen indicated that it had been filed. I attempted to put my bank routing information and it would not submit. I indicated I would send via mail, it still wouldn't submit. It's broken and needs to be fixed or refunds for the product should be returned for the purchase price. filled with gitches, screen blanking out | 45001080|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|717

Struggled for hours to figure out how to process, I called customer service. The lady answered the phone was very unprofessional and rude. Not only knowing how to talk to customers in correct ways, she asked me to pay to talk to the Technical Support. No help at all. I do not understand the reason this company made announcement which they can't follow. I've been using TurboTax for years but this will be the last year.  | 45001079|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|718

2 | Annoyed I chose the program that was free for the Federal return and $30 for the state. The process was very simple and well guided. I was happy with the process of filling out the information. I believed I had declined all opportunities to upgrade. As I finished up, I had an extra charge of $30. I went back through the process several times to ensure that I did not approve any upgrades. I felt that this was a complete bait and switch situation and my fee was doubled at the very end. Surprise cost at the end | 45001010|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|725

3 | Full Pricing Shouldn't Be A Surprise I also did not like how you sprang another Fee on me when I had to report a K-1 Form which is a rare event this year. I had no indication ahead of time that this would spark a higher fee structure. The fees just keep flying at you. I really think this is particularly inexcusable with respect to filing State Taxes. Obviously most people want to do both. You should make it clear what it will cost upfront to do both instead of making the price seem lower!

Finally, I was offered a $20 discount because of coming to you from Vanguard but I did not see that Deduction in price clearly reflected. I think there was some discount but I don't think it was $20. I strongly dislike how you spring new fees when it comes to filing State Taxes together with Federal. BE HONEST UPFRONT | 45000990|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|728
3 | Update your system I tried to pay for the state portion, but every time I tried to pay an error message said they could not validate my credit card information and then i had 5 purchases/reversals and then 2 purchases on my bank statement. That is not alright, it could have told me my address was wrong, my phone number, etc etc etc. From beginning to finish when I actually got that part over with and then filing my taxes took over 3 hours.

3 | I've been happier with Intuit. I have always liked Intuit and the products that you provide. My taxes are completed and you tell me that they have been filed correctly and accurately. Thank you.

I have to tell you that the sales team bouncing across the screen every other page <on tax day> is extremely annoying. If I am using a free version, that would be one thing. I shouldn't have to put up with that once I'd upgraded.

Additionally, I started with the free version and that would probably have completed my taxes effectively. Having all of my data and strong-arming me on tax day for the 29.99, disregarded my years of loyalty with you, but didn't surprise me. You're right, if you don't care about customer loyalty, that was well worth my time and again, thank you.

I want someone to explain to me why you strong-armed the sale of the Deluxe package before you would complete the filing, Popping up every few screens to tell me that Deluxe was a better option, and then telling me that I had to do the upgrade to complete filing, leaves me questioning the integrity of that sale; was the $25 more important than integrity? Unless there was a reason that was never explained, I didn't see any value from it and would like to know why that was important enough to stop my filing and what benefitted me or my return. The sales team needs to take a break!! | 45000970|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|731

1 | Very disappointed this year Very disappointed that I went through the trouble of doing my Federal return and 5 state returns to find out Premier couldn't complete my taxes because I worked in 7 states. Had to download and upgrade then after hours of transferring and rechecking, my resident state return still isn't correct. Lots of money now invested and tons of time for inaccurate return that I can't figure out how to correct it as it is not in the questions it is in the calculations. I'm taxed for income made in other states appropriately and again in my home state again. Thus it shows I owe my home state because nothing was withheld for it on out of state earnings. Been using Turbo Tax Premier since 2009 and never had this much problems or this much expense. Very disappointed.

1 | Lied to me I began doing my tax return thinking that it was free. No matter what I did, they were charging US$29.99 to file. Decided to pay, and got charged US$59.98 without knowing. The system said it was 29.99 and after I input my credit card number, it charges 59.98. No way to go back, no way to ask for a refund. Turbotax stole from me. Charges more than it tells you | 45000798|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|745
3 | Confusing during e-filing PIN/AGI verification Several problems with filing flow: 1) It gave 2 choices for the state, either e-file or put it off until later. What about printing to send by mail? 2) The PIN / AGI ID verification flow didn't make sense. It asked for status but didn't use the information in the following steps. Selecting married filing jointly yielded entering AGI for both spouses by name as if I selected married filing separately. There was no explanation of what to enter so I accepted what was automatically entered, the 2013 joint AGI for each of us. This resulted in the IRS rejecting the return, not good on the evening of 15 April! 3) It would be good if somewhere before the filing flow starts if you would explain that you can e-file the return early and request TurboTax to submit payment on 15 April. If I had known this I would have filed a week earlier. The flow is wrong for PIN/AGI entry for Married filing Jointly | 45000786|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|746
3 | Could have been a little better I would have given a 10 if I didn't have to correct the same info over and over again. I think there was a glitch in the California Worksheet section cause every time I would make corrections, making sure it was not directly on the form itself, I would have to make the same corrections all over again! Very frustrating considering I was already charged to file my state income tax so mailing them which was the other option, was not an option for me. Also it would have been better if you could only go to specific parts on the forms to edit something without going through the whole thing all over again. Too many glitches on certain sections and would take awhile to save information | 45000776|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|747
3 | Pay for state e-file, yet can't pay state tax It is a very simple program to use to maximize your returns, However, I would never pay to file the state forms through Turbo tax due to the fact that you still have to print off forms and submit them to the state and you can't pay state tax electronically. I felt it was pretty misleading to offer the electronic option and not be able to satisfy the state requirements. very misleading in paying for state e-file yet you still have to print off forms and can't pay electronically.

3 | WI State form not correct I have used Turbo Tax for over 10 years and loved it. This year I had problems with the state return. I itemized the federal return and wanted to itemized the state but it chose a different form so I couldn't itemized. This resulted in only half the $ amount for deductions and us owing a lot more state tax. I tried to override it and complete the correction form but it wouldn't let me fill in all the blanks.

3 | Deluxe wasn't worth it for me It would be more helpful to know what the benefit would be to use Deluxe to fully check out the return including the credit in question, compared to my return without using Deluxe.
In the end, it was a waste of my money.
Perhaps you can offer a way to delete the deluxe selection if it doesn't actually benefit the tax payer.
Despite this, I found the interface for the rest of the program to be helpful, and even personable. I paid about $60 for Deluxe and it didn't save me anything | 45000733|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|755
1 | Expensive and No Longer My Choice This will be the last year I use Turbo Tax, the value for the service no longer exists. I'm using my entire return just to process my taxes. The deceptive practice of forcing me to upgrade to an addition I don't need just to file investment income is just a slap in the face for loyal customers. Value for money is lacking and forcing to upgrade is unfair and deceptive | 45000725|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|756
2 | love the ease didn't like paying extra for 1 form I have used turbotax for many years and have always enjoyed the comfort of knowing my taxes were done correctly and very easy. This year our business took on a partner and we had to use turbo tax business to file. The cost was $250. We only needed the business download to file a k1. I understand this used to be included in previous versions of home and business. Seems like an awful lot of money for what we used the product for. I did not like having to pay an extra $250 just to be able to file a k1 this year | 45000720|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|757
3 | Too Many levels of service! In the past I was able to select the level of service from turbotax that I wanted. This year I was forced into the small business level. My spouse did a small project as independent worker for a foundation in 2013, and they made the final payment in 2014. It was about $10K, and not a small business.
I could not figure out how to get the level of service, deluxe, that I have used the past many years. I got overcharged for higher level of service | 45000697|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|758

2 | 2014 Tax Software I was able to get the job done...after I paid extra money out of my pocket. Been a Turbo Tax user greater than 10 years. I have never had to upgrade software, until this year. Typically, I would go to Costco, purchase the software, do my taxes, and be done. This year, I had to spend EXTRA money to accomplish something that should have...and all previous years have...been included with the original price. Next year, I will be searching for other software. The only reason I gave a "two-star" rating...intuit offered a rebate for "customer loyalty." Next time, don't mess with a good thing.

1 | Longtime Turbo Tax User- No Longer After This Year We have successfully used Turbo Tax since 1993. Previously we raved about Turbo Tax and highly recommended it to family and friends. After this year, we will no longer use Turbo Tax and recommend everyone we know use another tax preparation software.

We have always used Turbo Tax Deluxe for our personal and home-based business taxes. This year, Turbo tax changed and the product that used to cost us less than $30, is no longer available. We were forced to upgrade to the $94 program.

Instead of looking for tax deductions and breaks, this new version seemed to skip over everything and we wound up paying $1700 more this year than last year, according to Turbo Tax, and nothing has changed in our situation....if fact we made less. Horrible product and we will not longer support Turbo Tax in any version. Everything | 45000582|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|771

2 | UGH! Bugs in the software! I tried MULTIPLE times to get the .tax file which I could see, but was locked, to download. I got a new computer and didn't have the file from last year. It kept telling me I had to "upgrade" BUT the only upgrades available were the higher tiers. The other two were "grayed out" and not accessible even though the import of last year's return was featured on the description of each of those products. They weren't a radio button to choose at the bottom of the upgrade screen. I didn't need those since I don't have rental properties or more complicated tax issues. HOWEVER, when I did click, it STILL didn't import last year's file #saying it was still locked!# and I still got stuck paying the higher $79 fees for the upgrade I didn't need in the first place.
SO VERY ANNOYING. I have been using this product for over a decade and have NEVER had these issues. DID NOT IMPORT LAST YEARS NUMBERS!!! | 45000577|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|773

3 | Great Product - If you can get it to install! I bought the CD version, but it had an error when I tried to install it. So I called TurboTax. After waiting for an hour to talk to someone and spending another 1.5 hours on the phone, he told me I would have to download the produce. I started the download, but it took all night and then failed. I retried the download, and that worked, but it would not install. I called TurboTax again, and after an hour wait, a woman tried to help me. After about 2.5 hours on the phone, I got cut off, and she did not call back. I then called again and had to wait another hour to talk to a rep. After trying to help me install it again for about an hour, he suggested that I could use the online product. That was not what I wanted, but had to accept it. As a result of all this wasted time, I lost one day of work, and didn't get my return filed until 11:28PM on Apr 15!

2 | Paid a lot more in 2014 for the same features We were unpleasantly surprised when we tried to take the itemized deduction using TurboTax Basic 2014. It required $40 to upgrade in order to itemize my deductions. I found that deceitful for TurboTax to use the same name but took out major features. If TurboTax were to try to provide flexibility for individuals who do not use the Schedule A form, a different package name should have been given to that new package. It is a shame for TurboTax to use such an underhanded method to earn a few more bucks. I suggest you to check your online feedback. It is not favorable at all!

1 |  Turbotax is ridiculous and a classic bait and switch tactic. States I can file federal free and just be charged for state filings. Then I was required to upgrade to deluxe then pay the state fee on top of it making it cost nearly $100 from the anticipated $20. I will never use turbotax again. If I'm going to spend $100 to have my taxes done I will have a local accountant do it for me. Also, taking your customer support number off of your website on the last day to file is very unprofessional. Filling out a form to be called back is not a guarantee anyone will call and is poor customer service.  | 45000482|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|786

The biggest refund advertisement just sounds fraudulent, this program is difficult if you know what you're doing because it won't just let you do it... and if you don't know what you're doing... it's an outright disaster waiting to happen... missed my state sales tax deduction and i live in a no income tax state. biggest refund guaranteed? that's a lie.... | 45000457|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|788
1 | No more Turbo Tax for me I have used Turbo Tax for years, and I realize I am filing on April15th, but I will never ever, ever, ever us TT again due to the excessive fees charged, especially for state filing. Next year I will be using TaxAct and I wish I had taken the advice of Forbes and used TaxAct this year.

2 | Bring back the original version! Previous years' version was far better. It seemed smoother to load and easier to enter information.

This year, it took 2 hours to download the program. Then I got gouged with the State filing fees #x 3#. We were doing the taxes for our son, who earned money in 2 states and thought that this would be a good way to get him started via Turbo Tax.

We purchased a copy of the Ohio state tax form for $42 and then got socked a $24.99 filing fee on top of this. After all that, he got a $3 refund. To add insult to injury, when filling out our Federal taxes, we discovered - too late - that he didn't even need to file if he made less than $6,000. Why didn't Turbo Tax mention that instead of gouging us $66 and putting us through lots of aggravation?

Lesson learned. Steer clear of Turbo Tax and find another program that will keep my best interest in mind. Thanks for nothing. Extra hidden fees - ouch!!!! | 45000437|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|793

I already paid $59.99 (+tax) for the software. Including the ability to e-file at least 1 state return would be a significant improvement on your software.
The least you could have done was make that information easily accessible early on in the filing process. You didn't and I felt like I was about to get sucker punched for over $25. Not cool from a customer service standpoint. I will definitely share that negative aspect with all of my friends. Have to pay to e-file state tax returns. | 45000363|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|801

1 | GOT SCREWED BY TURBOTAX! I've been using TurboTax for many years now, and I'm highly disappointed in their deceptive trade practices - the price to file my return went up between the time I started my return and the time I filed it. This is the first year I've noticed it, probably because in the past I was almost always due a refund so I filed early. This year I owe the IRS, so I waited until the last day to file, and BAM! Adding insult to injury, now I had to pay about $15-$20 more to TurboTax. That's bull**it!! I'm putting you fools on notice - no more recommendations to friends and family!!

2 | Disappointed After performing an analysis of my state return, when I click "Let's finish it," I am bounced back to the beginning of the State Taxes tab and stuck in a perpetual loop. The only way to proceed is to click the 'skip it' option, so I was never stepped through the analysis of my state taxes. Fingers crossed that it got it right the first time.

Separately, but remotely possibly related, it would not allow me to pay off the feds and make payment arrangements for the state. It told me I had selected to make a direct deposit payment to the state, which I don't recall being prompted to do, and never had the option to change it. I had to trick the system by checking that I would mail in a payment and then make payment arrangements with the state directly.

All excruciatingly frustrating, and why I've been (over) paying a CPA to do this up until now. I had hoped Intuit would have gotten this dialed in by now. disappointingly flawed | 45000257|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|816
3 | No title Turbo Tax is okay, if you can't get out. If you can, better to file with free tax service for low income. Turbo Tax is free for federal tax, but costs for state tax. It's a bit difficult to navigate if you're not used to tax form numbers and what they're for. Sometimes you can click on something for information and you're lost - especially at the end. I hadn't finished, but I couldn't tell what was going on. It wasn't moving, didn't give me any options to move forward or back or off the information page. I had to get out and go back and sign in again. Luckily, it picked it back up where I left off. The state part costs money, so if you're getting refunds, you'd probably be better off going to a free tax filing servic | 45000254|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|817
1 | forced upgrade to premier This review relates to the online version of turbotax software.

As a customer of TurboTax for several years now i have been extremely unpleasantly surprised to discovered that i had been "scammed" into upgrading to a premier service i did not need in the end (i had been using deluxe over the previous years with great satisfaction)

I thought i needed special extra needs for the investment section however it turns out i did not need to do anything special this year that was not available in the deluxe edition.

So after the upgrade i looked for a way to downgrade back from Premier to Deluxe which is the level of service appropriate to my needs.

I was trusting that turbotax was a serious company and would make this seamless but i was wrong.

While looking at the forum and other resources i realized that like many people before me, turbotax this year made it easy within seconds to transfer all your data from deluxe to premier. However, although they are *legally* obliged to give you a way to downgrade, they made the *effective* usability cost for users very high by forcing them to delete ALL their data and start over from scratch.

This is of course completely ridiculous and hypocritical because there's no more technical difficulty in switching from deluxe to premier (seconds) than from premier to deluxe.

For instance in my case, i was filing a few hours from the deadline so it was unimaginable for me to start over so soon from the midnight deadline.

So all in all, i guess some marketing representatives thought they were clever to let the online software earn an extra $30 from their gullible customers. But it is short sighted because it destroys the trust relationship with customers and now I have a very bad image of TurboTax practices as a company (even if their base service is of good quality)

That is too bad because they will probably loose my business for next year as well as the one from many other infuriated customers falsely pretend that downgrading back to deluxe requires clearing all data to start over | 45000245|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|818

1 | Terrible. Thanks for repeatedly trying to sell me on Amazon, gift cards, and all kinds of junk. Also, for tricking me into the 99$ service and making it impossible to go back without undoing all my work. Thanks for being another trashy business that clearly only cares about profits. I am never filing with you again. I'd rather pay exorbitant fees elsewhere.. but not be tricked into it. What a sham of a business.

3 | Confusing There were a few deductions I needed to make and couldn't figure out how. My car expenses are way higher than the mileage I use for work, and I feel I could have received more. Also, the Heath Insurance section just asked if I was insured throughout the year. I got no deduction for my high monthly payments. My health insurance i not an employment benefit, I have to pay the full amount out of pocket. I should have received a deduction for that.

1 | Software has been getting worse every year. In an attempt to become idiot proof, Intuit has taken even the simplest of things out of the user's control. I moved from an apartment to a house and the software would not allow me to update my address; each time it reviewed my state return, it threw back an error because there was no apartment number. Seeing as the software would not allow me to transmit my returns without that information, I had to put in a placeholder. As far as I can tell there is absolutely no way to edit that manually, and updating your address in your turbotax account info will not change it either. A true rip-off at $60 for state and federal. I will never use this software again. Can't even change your address manually. | 45000225|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|823

3 | Downgraded I have used TurboTax since 1986. It has always been my tax program of choice. Now that they have changed the schedules that you can use with each program, I am thinking about changing the program I use for 2015. The pricing of Deluxe for $50, Premier for $90 and Home and Business for $100. In order to do my tax return for 2014 I bought Deluxe but ended up using Home and Business so I could use a Schedule C to report about $350 gross income. In years before I could do this using Deluxe. The upgrade cost of $50 is more than the tax I will owe on the net income I am earning and reporting on my Schedule C which to be an honest taxpayer Turbo Tax is going to be charging me. If it is going to cost me an extra $50 to report my taxes in 2015. I will be changing to another program. I also do not have a lot of Schedule D items but need to report them also. I think TurboTax has made a big mistake in splitting up their programs like they did in 2014. Change in pricing | 45000177|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|830
2 | 2013 Yes, 2014 Not So Much When I filled my tax return for 2013 I was very satisfied with Turbo Tax, this year not so much. The product itself was good and pretty easy to use. My issues lay more with customer care(service). Some life situations were pretty complicated for my family last year seeing as we are a military family. There were a few things that I needed help with. I submitted my question, got my "Incident ID #", called the number they gave and waited over an hour for someone to call me back. I ended up doing this a few times attempting to get help just once. Each time I got a call back it was from Product Support who couldn't help. A couple people transferred me to Tax Support for the help I needed. I ended up being on hold for hours at a time when transferred. Another time I was given a direct number for Tax Support. When I called I was asked for my "Incident ID #" or to press zero by an automated system. With both I got the same response... My questions weren't important because they didn't pertain to the deadline and that if I wanted them answered I could call back after the sixteenth of April, then it hung up on me. I still have yet to talk to someone in Tax Support. I finally gave up and went elsewhere for help that way our taxes could be filed before the deadline. I understand that they get swamped this time of the year, HOWEVER, it doesn't make it right for them to put a number for tax help that is really for product help or to leave people on hold just because they want to go home when they have people who have been on hold for hours before they are supposed to close and when it was an estimated wait of only sixty minutes that turned into a minimum of two hours -not including the hour or so waiting for someone to call in the first place. In all I would recommend Turbo Tax for the product itself, NOT for the help. When help was needed it was nowhere to be seen like it was claimed to be. | 45000166|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|831

3 | Federal Free I love Turbo tax, it's simply and user friendly. That being said I think it would be beneficial to make the pricing a little more clear in the beginning. I ended up paying for the federal version when I really needed to be federal free. It all evens out in the end so I didn't stress about it but, in order to get the Federal free version as originally anticipated I would have had to start completely over. Maybe making it to where to you don't have to start from scratch would make it a better experience for the non-tax professional, like myself.

I remember getting a spammy email saying "last day to get normal pricing", so it seems like they are taking advantage of people who wait till the last week to do their taxes (thats MOST people I know). Too expensive...more then twice as much as last year... | 45000132|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|841
2 | Disappointed I have faithfully used turbo tax since 2006 and i have recommended the service to many of my friends, but now I am going to seek out an alternative software. I am very disappointed that turbo tax continues to increase its prices and adds ambiguous fees. The cost of using turbo tax has increased significantly | 45000122|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|842
3 | What happened I loved Turbo tax from Day 1...a few years ago. today I had the worst experience. Hard to get around, make changes, explanations are hard to understand, maybe I am just getting too old! What happened to two the program. | 45000103|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|843
1 | Convenient, but Pricey Convenient, but pricey. I have no mortgage, children to claim, etc. I could have filed the 1040 EZ, but because I sold about 10 shares of stock I had to pay $80 on top of the $40 for the state return. I ended up losing money. Expemsive | 45000097|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|844

2 | Disappointed I haven't used TurboTax for a few years and I ordered it online this year because I had taken a partial withdrawal from my IRA.
I was very confused on some of the explanations, and final had to consult a professional in order to reenter some figures in the right place.
It was not only hard for me to understand some parts, but the tax professional I was using was not happy not being able to view the forms, as they progressed through TurboTax questions.
Maybe buying the actual program would have been a different experience, but it's too late now. Unable to view forms, not good explanations | 45000075|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|846

2 | Repeated Debt to IRS with Turbo-Tax Everything was fine until you get to the part of community property income in Texas. Questions are a little confusing and it still does not make sense to me. I am filing as married but separated this year. Every year I try to max out the recommended tax withholding's to avoid any high tax bills but every year I end up owing close to $1000. I have never received a return with turbo tax. Not easy to understand some parts | 45000067|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|848
1 | Stop being so Positive! I owed this year, first time I have ever owed money. It wasn't much compared to some people, only $410. But it is still depressing and certainly something I don't want to do. I work VERY hard for my money all year long. The website kept everything peppy and happy AS IF I WAS going to get a refund. Come on, tell it like it really is. Cheer me up for having to owe money, make me feel better about the situation. Don't make it sound like using TurboTax is the greatest thing in the world when I have to PAY THE GOVERNMENT my money. It was such a slap in the fave every time I would hit "Continue" and the website would say "You're almost to your refund!". To darn happy! | 45000065|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|849
2 | #nickelanddimeme Errors that just take you in circles! I've been using Turbo Tax for along time, but was very disappointed this year, no free filing, charging for everything! Can only file 5 returns? Needs to be disclosed before you buy and maybe a warning when you get to number 4.! Charging for everything. No free filing, have to pay for state | 45000061|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|850
1 | free? Thought I was doing free and wasn't because of this deceiving site. I owed about the same amount on my taxes as the fee they charged. I though I was paying the amount due....nope just paid turbotax. Enjoy the free money you worthless **** never using you again and I hope your family burns a slowly while you watch said it would be free.... | 45000057|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|851
2 | TurboTax The app is easy to use but I feel like I got side-swiped when I went to 'send' my forms. First, I had to change to the more expensive home & business version because my wife was contracted #not employed# by a mother's-day-out. Fine, pay the extra for 1 form #Schedule C#. I go to check-out and say pay the TurboTax Home & Business version from my refund and I'm charged an additional $35 for the benefit of paying from my refund. $85 for TT and an additional $35 fee to use my refund. Tends to repeat things too much. A fee for paying for TurboTax with my refund, really? | 45000050|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|852
1 | Rip Off They only let you take their money out of your federal return if you pay an extra $30, but when the window comes up it says something like "Your tax fees are waived bla bla if you upgrade to Turboplus and pay with your federal return"
So when you actually do update, they charge you the $30 for your state, and the extra $30 bucks on top of that, but by the time you realize that you are so far into the process you just want to be done with it.
Honestly if I had my credit card on me I would have saved myself the $30 dollar convenience fee, but unfortunately my wife has my wallet in her purse, and today is the last day for tax day.
Go figure.
Bottom line is I really feel like there are no additional services provided for the $30 other then the fact that I can get online and look over my taxes during the year. (Why i would do this is a mystery to me).
I can pay $30 for a service, but at the point that I'm already DONE with all the hard stuff, paying $30 bucks to not have to enter my credit card number is complete rubbish.
AND THEN, to top it all off they make you take your refund onto a prepaid debit card if you choose this option! REALLY?! So for that extra $30 bucks you can't even give me a check?
I feel like its a rip off to be honest. Selling an upgrade on a service after the service is already pretty much completed is petty, gimmicky, phony, misleading etc. Pick your adjective. REALLY hardball you into buying their stuff. | 45000030|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|853
3 | Confused and no help Options for inputting data for RRB-1099-R are not clear and leaves you searching and reviewing more than should be necessary. There are 3 options to choose for receiving the benefit (and you must pick one) on the screen for the RRB-1099-R , none of them apply to my situation. I received this as a divorce settlement - I am not retired or disabled nor am I an RR employee. Take a chance and pick something and hope it doesn't make a difference. Locating where to document the data from your tax form should be more user friendly. Can't seem to get a valid answer | 45000027|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|854
1 | Pricey! I sold a couple of stocks....I don't own a home, have children to claim etc....I could have used the 1040EZ, but because I sold about 10 shares of stock I had to pay $80 for fedreral on top of the $40 for the state return. Next year. I think I'll do my own returns! Expemsive | 45000021|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|855
1 | Misleading on completing multiple returns Turbo Tax online and the CD/Download versions are different in terms of paying once and completing multiple returns. After paying once to file my return and believing I could do up to 5 returns, I was forced to pay again to file my sons return.Very disappointed to go all the way through the effort to enter data only to find out at the end that I have to pay again because it was the online version rather than the CD/Downloaded version. Great tax software, and very upset to pay twice for something that is advertised to be used for up to 5 returns.  | 45000005|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|856
3 | Easy file this year I appreciate you need to recoup your money and make a profit on the state returns, but it it not worth my money. I have printed and submitted a paper form.

Also this year my discount was not applied What happened?? Price to file state taxes, Did not receive my discount | 45000003|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|857
2 | Cost too much!!! I don't like that I was charged $60.00 for filing taxes and then another $40.00 charge was tacked on for some reason. You charged me $100.00 to do my own taxes and I probably won't be back next year. Cost too much!!!! | 45000000|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|858

1 | Turbo Tax Sucks! Turbo Tax needs to get there act together. I bought the home and small business edition, which is SUPPOSED to come with the state edition yet STILL ended up having to pay $39.99 to get the state and it STILL didn't work! I spent two days and about 5 hours on the phone with customer service just to fix the state return issue. Not cool. Problems with turbo tax each year i've used it...only twice | 44999991|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|860
1 | RIPPED ME OFF AND UNABLE TO GET HELP LAST YEAR TURBO TAX CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD FOR THE STATE FILING FEE THEN SENT ME A MESSAGE SAYING I WAS INELIGIBLE TO FILE MY STATE RETURN ELECTRONICALLY. IT TOOK ME TWO HOURS TO FIND A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL. THEN I WAS ON HOLD FOR 2 1/2 HOURS BEFORE THE BATTERY IN MY PHONE DIED. I KEPT GETTING EMAIL REMINDERS TO E-FILE FROM TURBO TAX, BUT REPLYS WENT UNANSWERED. ALTHOUGH I HAVE THE BALANCE OF THE UNUSED FEE PAID LAST YEAR, THEY CHARGED ME AGIAN THIS YEAR. THAT SEEMS DISHONEST TO ME. I WOULD THINK A COMPANY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE RELY ON WOULD MAKE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE EASIER TO REACH AND WOULD CREDIT PEOPLE BACK ANY UNEARNED FEES THAT THEY CHARGED. SURELY TURBOTAX MUST MAKE SUFFICIENT MONEY WITHOUT RIPPING OFF ITS CUSTOMERS. CHARGED ME FOR STATE E-FILE THEN SAID NOT ELIGIBLE | 44999986|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|861
1 | Disappointed Really disappointed ... I only owed 12.00 ... my deductions doing nothing for me ... your site should run it every different way for best and easiest and cheapest outcome for the customer. It should import all info if you want to try the free or downgrade to any lesser program. I waited till tonight as I only owed 12.00 ... no reason to hurry as I had to pay 30..00 to pay 12.00 ... or so I thought then/now I am paying 54.99 and 12.00 and 3.95 to pay it electronically with my CARD. Sorry so irritated. Will not use this site again. sl not importing info for free file/ and higher charge at end I only owed 12.00 | 44999985|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|862

2 | not really free why would you advertise at being free then charge me $30? You tell me I didn't get enough to use the return to pay but still charge me. I'm clearly picking the free option because I can't anything else but I get charged anyway. False advertising, I would rather have someone else do it where I know I'm going to pay than think I don't have to pay & end up being told that I actually do have to pay. even the free option is not free | 44999972|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|864

1 | Hidden Fees Bought the turbo deluxe said it was 19.99 to file state, but when filing our second state we had to pay 39.99 to review our second state, Then they charged us 24.99 per state. And then charged us 49.98 to process it. It was 49.99 to buy turbo tax, 39.99 just to see our second state then 24.99 for each state plus 34.99 to process our taxes for a grand total of 174.99 and I could have paid my tax preparer for less than 150. So iI am a dissatisfied customer due to all the extra hidden fees. I will never use turbo tax again. The lies they said about the cost to file | 44999942|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|866
2 | Getting less and less from turbotax I have used turbotax about 10 years and I am thinking about find alternative next year. The reason is that Turbotax is getting cheaper and cheaper. And sneakier too. No contact phone. Once you completed printout, you can not make change again. They only have the short version this year instead of the long and short version in previous years. bad customer service | 44999940|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|867

1 | Frustrated and Annoyed I paid 39.99 for my federal tax the I paid 39.99 for the Colorado State tax, on line and then I went to file I had to pay another 24.99. I tried to go on line to ask my question and you wanted another 36.00 to answer my questions. I will NEVER recommend turbo tax or ever use it again. You are a rip off.  | 44999924|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|869
3 | Grade, B Paid for a premium product, partly in the belief that the state return was included. It was not. And then the disparity between being told you have all but no chance of an audit and then on the next screen there's a solicitation to be protected. It's misleading, deliberately no doubt. Plus the way Intuit now works with Amazon: how about just keeping to your core competency? And there are still problems with the program, particularly when it comes to fixing errors. Tip: always go to Forms when all else fails. And finally the community was no help.... That's the real problem; I've used this program for a few years and that's always been the case.... Community help is no help; program still has bugs and it can be difficult to track down an error and fix it | 44999920|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|870
1 | Not returning customer I have been using Turbotax for almost ten years, but with all of the pushing to upgrade, sneaking in extra fees, and overall disappointment in the system, I will not be a returning customer next tax season. I will be shopping around for a new system. I would have given the experience zero stars if I could. Everything | 44999908|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|871

1 | Absolutely Horrible!!!! I have been using Turbo Tax and Quickbooks for over 20 years and always used the Deluxe version for my personal and small business.
This year to my surprise when trying to file I found that I had to upgrade to Home and Business version to enter my schedule C. After trying the phone number given in the program to upgrade I was told to call after 4/16 which was not an option. I was then hung up on several times. I tried to find answers on the Turbo Tax website and couldn't connect with password and had to have a code no.emailed to me then had to go out of website to get email then when went back to website again couldn't enter with out code. Had to have my son get his computer to have 2 computers to enter website and found no answers or help there either.
Finally called the Intuit number and had to go through bunch of recordings to finally be told I would receive a call back. I waited hours for the call back and was given a conformation that didn't work. I went through this several times before I finally got a person the next day to stay on the line to get my upgrade.
After all this I had to buy an additional state and again wasn't able to online and had to call Intuit again same senario and wait hours for a call back to buy the additional state and get a conformation.
Then when I tried to efile it wouldn't let me online again and I was forced to pay an extra $39. to have the charges deducted from my refund because it was too late to call and wait hours again for another conformation.
This is ABSOLUTELY the worst experience I have had in over 20 years as a loyal Turbo Tax customer and I will probably change to another tax software company next year. Everything | 44999905|1|1|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|873

2 | Paid too much I was suppose to get the one time rate of $29.99 for DELUXE- which was great! However, I started over, switched to the FREE edition then ended up switching back to DELUXE. Be careful because ONE TIME rate...really means ONE TIME. That doosy cost me $25. Oh well...you live and you learn. paid too much | 44999895|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|875
1 | suck you advertise 5 federals and one state for free. I go to file state and you get me for $25, after I paid $60 up front. Bull S**t. I'll find an alternative next year, after more than a decade of paying for and enjoying your service-no more surprise charges | 44999894|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|876
1 | Regret Using Turbo The pricing posted was false. There was no one to contact to fix the situation. Next year I will be using H&R block or a different online service.
Customer service should be key and it doesnt seem to be with this site. The free advertisements are a joke. Total waste of time and money, Ill be sure to recommend everybody elsewhere. I didnt like the process. No one could be reached and the pricing was inaccurate | 44999889|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|877
2 | Too many advertisements for other products This system was nice and fast. However, it constantly had buttons to upgrade to different platforms that cost money to file state returns, etc. This was so distracting and annoying -- I ended up spending an hour filling out information on my state returns when I got to the end and had to cancel them because the only option to submit them was to pay a fee. Very misleading / a waste of time. too many "buy this" or "upgrade" buttons | 44999865|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|878
1 | Scam First you select to do a free federal return, and at some point, the software is supposed to inform you if you will be switched to the pay option due to (I'm guessing here because I still don't know...the software is THAT bad) itemizing. However, that never happened. Then, when it was time to complete the return, suddenly, you have to pay. No notification before hand. You try to switch to the free return, but it you can't. The only options you have are to pay or start over. And the tool tip has text on top of text, so, of course, you can't read it. I think that's done on purpose to frustrate customers who have already spent time filling out the forms. Who wants to start over after that? Probably no one. Turbo Tax knows this, and they know that you'll just go ahead and pay. It's a scam, and it's pathetic. The acquisition of the all-mighty dollar is goal here even if you have to misdirect and fool customers into obtaining it. Sadly, Turbo Tax has sunk to the bottom of the barrel with tactics such as this, and we will no longer be using their services...ever. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Does these reviews go to a public forum? If so, I seriously doubt this one will make it there. The company doesn't want people to know how it scams customers, but at least the person who does read this and decides to prevent it from being public knowledge will know what a pathetic company he/she works for. Making money is the focus, period | 44999860|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|879
1 | Horrible! I am eligible to file for free yet could not with Turbo Tax despite spending many hours completing. Went to site for free filing, said turbo tax was an option, went to turbo tax and had to pay full price. Will not be using Turbo Tax next year.

2 | Got charged for Free State e File I got a message that I had to pay to efile the State Return but there was supposed to be one free State efilling with my purchase of TurboTax. I trid to contact TurboTax support but no luck so far.... maybe I can resolve tomorrow. I went ahead and paid now so I coudl file and will ask for a refun or not to be charged tomorrow, April 16th.  | 44999842|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|881
3 |  Not as easy as prior years.
With problems that the software had this year, felt I needed to check the calculations

Suggest offering a brief of the major statutory changes up front that people could watch or work through before beginning taxes. Then surprises of all the additional taxes, treatments, etc will be lessened. Did not make me aware of all the tax changes up front/ had to laboriously go through worksheets to ensure it was correct | 44999837|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|882

But overall I like it...  | 44999824|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|883
1 | So many opportunities to be upsold and hassled I get it, writing software is expensive. But the never-ending prompts to hand off more money to Intuit as I try to do an already unpleasant task is just insulting. I paid for your software. Now you want me to buy more of your software. Or upgrade the software version I already deliberately selected.

All of that is tiresome enough, but to then get to the attempt to get me to get my refund in Amazon credits... when I am not getting a refund? Come on. You have a little box in the upper left with my totals. Asking me the question is insulting. Not already knowing that the question is stupid is sloppy. Endless upsell junk, sloppy coding, cruddy privacy policies | 44999820|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|884
3 | Watch out for the 2.9% service charge for credit 2.9 per cent to use a credit card to pay taxes...in small print at bottom of the payment options form..

Careful.. First Uncle Sam cleans your wallet and then Turbo Tax Turbo Charges You what is left of your sanity.

Prepop fields nice if used consecutive years

Need more clarification on some issues.

High charge for simple tax return--60 bucks. Really?

If only I could remember to file in advance of deadline I would look elsewhere

So the best positive is that the program is ready to run at quarter til deadline. Something to be said for that... Expensive Cost to use credit card | 44999807|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|885
1 | the worst customer service ive been with turbotax since 2009 and never had this experience before. using turbotax this year was horrible . the last agent that i talked to was so rude and didn't want to help at all. she kept repeating herself just like machine over and over again . at last i just hung up on her. unexperienced customer service | 44999788|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|886
2 | Nothing new here, move along... Turbo Tax has been around awhile. There are a number of opportunities where TT could provide suggestions or answers based on responses that I've provided and prior year patterns but instead we had to decide on our own. Also, why tell me about movie making credits and other esoteric employer credits when none of these apply to me? The UX doesn't flow as intuitively as it could and feels clunkier than in years past.

I found a bug - VA state version. The difference in the mileage credit rate (VA=18c/mi, Federal=14c/mi) amounted to a $7 VA credit but when continuing to the next screen where I could choose to allocate between myself and my spouse, TT auto populated $6 to me and 0 to my spouse. The expected result was a $7 pre-populated field. The observed $6+0 does not equal $7. Isn't very smart and makes me do too much of the work where TT should already have the answers | 44999783|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|887
1 | So many hidden tricks this year!! Not free after all. Very disappointed. So many sales pitches Amazon, Sunrise Bank, Auditing - fees everywhere!! like pop ups without your permission.

Still don't know why I had to pay $29.99 twice! But since it is April 15 and running out of time....just went with the program. The phone number provided tells you they can't take your call and disconnects!!!! What a joke.
other than that it is still very easy to use and the help/search section is very easy to understand and implement. Still will look for a really free site next year, even though I will have to start over. I hate hidden fees!! Or fees that you feel you HAVE to pay!! Expecting a free File - charged twice for $29.99! | 44999749|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|888
1 | Took money out of my refund terrible site I wouldn't recommend anyone because it took 59 dollars out of my refund and I had no other option to opt out. so either way I had to pay. it took money out and i thought it was free | 44999736|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|889
3 | Not your best year Not your best year - silly to get to last pages and then have to go back and fix things on a form at the beginning - I found that exhausting. Couldn't understand how to change bank acct info, found some pages confusing | 44999711|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|890
3 | Decent, but missed a significant calculation All is great, with the exception of how my personal exemption was calculated. By using the IRS.gov form, my personal exemption deduction was $4,000 higher than what TurboTax calculated. Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to manually change the entry in my return...now Uncle Sam is walking with $4K of my money that he should not have.

1 | angry was told that the sate tax payment was 14.99 and was unexpectedly charged 44 dollars out of my account instantly. i go to college and the fact that they charged me 44 dollars is unbelievable. Thanks turbo tax really f-ed me over. state payment | 44999682|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|896
3 | Upset about the 29.99 misrespresentation I was very upset that I was misled to thinking it would only be 29.99 to send my state returns. I tried for 40mins to get out of the screen so that I wasn't paying for the turbo program too. it would now allow me to no matter what way I tried. I feel that is misrepresentation and misleading to customers. I finally paid with my credit card and only had to pay the 29.99 program. this is unfair to people who are trying to get the money out of their check. They can not get their check unless they pay the extra 29.99. money | 44999663|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|897
1 | Poor Planning or just a scam Is it poor planning on your part or just a scam with apple that I would have to pay to upgrade my system to use your 2014 program. I didn't realize this until after trying to install the program. Then I had to buy your online version, more expensive than the disk I originally purchased. I have used your program for many years, if the next years program is not compatible with my Leopard version of Mac,I will be switching to something else. it can't be hard for your programmers to make this work.

3 | Easy...but not cost efficient $50 for deluxe, then had to spend another $30 to upgrade to Premier to submit my husbands K-1 with no income reported on it. Yes, I understand the difference and yes, I should've been more careful choosing the product, but after using it so many years in a row, I went with the version I always used previously. Wouldn't it be easier for consumers to pay a smaller fee based on what they're reporting? I didnt like that I had to pay $50 and then another $30 to upgrade to submit a K-1 with no income. | 44999650|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|899
1 | Frustrated family I (and my family) have used Turbo Tax to file our taxes for years. Based on my frustrating experience this year, I will be in the market for a new method of filing my taxes next year. I began with the Deluxe Version, but had to upgrade to the Business version because I needed a Schedule C. I understood I was eligible for a rebate for the additional cost if I used Turbo Tax last year, but I was unable to determine how to apply for this rebate when I purchased the upgrade. After I installed the upgrade, the program began to freeze and I was no longer able to open any of the "help" links. My overall experience was extremely frustrating. Extremely glitchy, would not open help boxes | 44999647|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|900

3 | Mixed Thoughts I do not think most of the recommended "upgrades" gave me any advantage. I paid almost twice as much as any tax provider that I used before. If you just use the free Federal Tax Return you can't go wrong. But you need to do your own state returns. Additional Fees kept increasing without producing any savings. | 44999624|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|902
1 | Using turbotax is like signing up to be mislead I purchased what appeared to be the correct tax software, after I had started the process of doing my taxes I was asked for $30+taxes more for the Delux version that would allow me to fill out the forms for the sale of a house. And then when I got to state taxes, I discovered that the filing wasn't included just the forms. In the past TurboTax has been a brand that I trusted. I wont make that mistake again. It cost 49 for the software, 30 to upgrade and 25 to file for state. I will use different software next year.

1 | Inept and greedy I am disgusted with the poor quality and the greed. E.g., 2.5% of my payment to use my credit card?! $152 transaction fee?!

Next year I won't be using Turbo Tax, that's for sure. I had to look up codes on third party sites. TurboTax kept trying to sell extras. Charge my card $152 for use of credit. | 44999602|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|904
3 | Turbo tax Premier vs Business Premier wins due to the easy import from our brokerage accounts. Plus, the State filing was key!

Business version fails due to no import capability on trust accounts. We have hundreds of transactions that have to be reported and without the import turbotax wasn't worth what I paid. Also, right ....my state (TN) was not listed as one of the states available to use the automated filing. Very disappointing. I hope they correct this by next year.

2 | Refund Cost was a bit too high. Many tax professionals in my area will do your taxes for less than 30usd. This is a computer program, I understand that there is cost to maintain this software but there nothing better then having a person do them. The only reason why I filed this year through intuit, to save embarrassment due to the lack of income I made last year. I understand the 2.49% charge to pay the taxes. But the intuit charge was too high. Cost, a bit high. Most tax professionals have services for less | 44999553|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|909
1 | Way too expensive!!! Each year the price creeps up what used to be an amazing simple service has gotten way too expensive with tons of "upgrades" or micro-transactions. I have a simple tax return the only complication that I have is a HSA which to me should be a standard item rather than an additional expense. When turbo tax opened up I had no other option to file other than the Deluxe "flavor" I had to dig a bit to allow it the option of choosing the free file. I will be filling early and on my own next year. The program is great though if it weren't for the fact of being forced to spend so much just to do what the free 'flavor" does minus automatically importing my info from last year I would have given it the 5 stars the software deserves. way too expensive I have a very simple tax return yet I have to pay $58.00 | 44999523|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|910

3 | Turbo is very good, but still a few problems Ive been using Turbo since 1996, almost a decade and it gets a little better each year. I had some problems this time where some forms that I filled out in the beginning were not carried over to later portions and I had to re-enter them multiple times. Also on the state form, there were several very tricky pages and they contained no help button, so I was forced to use Google since even the top search bar was no help in those items.

Other than those 2 problems, it is very good. I had a 2 friends try out Turbo for the first time this year after I told them it was very easy to use. Both of these friends needed only the free and easy version. The first friend had never done taxes before anywhere else and after a little help from me on the first page he was able to complete his taxes in about 2 hours and was super happy that it was so easy!

The second friend I had try out Turbotax usually had somone else do her taxes each year and didnt know what to do. I tried to help her by sitting down and guiding her through it. But she wanted to have the site switch into Spanish language to help her read and understand all the questions. We were unable to locate a language switch, so she got very frustrated and didnt want me to help her out. I offered to walk her through the whole process and explain everything on each page. But after 30 minutes she gave up and went back to her old accountant.

For people like me and my first friend, Turbotax is great.

However, I do not agree with the price increase. It was $130 last year. This year the price increased to $135, but I didnt get any benefit or added features from this new price. Most people today are still hurting from this depression that started in 2008. I havent yet gotten any raise in 8 years. Why should TurboTax get a raise? If the price goes up again in 2015, I will switch to H&R Block or another company. price went up $5 from last year for no reason. state forms had some problems. | 44999433|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|924

3 | Needs a little more work The military spouse relief act has caused me major problems two year in a row now using turbotax. The program doesn't seem to be fully developed to deal with the specifics of the act. Last year the form was never even included in my return, at least that's what the state of Maine told me was the issue. This year there was more confusion and issues. Also there are problems with the first time home buyers credit that was offered between 2006-2012 (I think) the program was forcing me to enter a current year date of not using residence as main home but we still owned the home and had only vacated in military orders and were renting. Anyways otherwise great program. Look forward to using next year. Thank you military benefits and deductions | 44999372|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|928
1 | Never Using Again TurboTax went the way of the ripoff.

I've used this desktop and online product since the 1990s without issue until this year. For the past four years, I purchase the home and business version which costs me plenty.

Now I have to pay to get my prior year returns and the system refused to pre-populate my 2013 data. I wasted an additional two hours hand jamming my own information.

Next year, I'll pay someone to do my taxes 2013 tax return data never pre-populated | 44999353|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|929

Identical to TurboTax. I've used TurboTax since it's what I've used for 10+ years. My error, for sure ,for not checking. It won't happen again.

1 | Unreasonable Fees I will never file with turbotax for as long as I live, and I will encourage my friends and family to use alternatives, as well. The fees you are now charging are unbelievable. I can't believe you even charge $35 to deduct the cost from the refund (that was a nice trick kinda hiding that cost. I almost didn't notice it before I filed).

In the digital age where there are so many cheaper and even free options, it blows my mind that you would drive your own customers away by price gouging them.

The only reason I completed filing through you this year was because I filed late due to some personal issues, and I did not have time to complete my taxes elsewhere. But I promise that this is the last time. I am done with this site, and for the rest of my life I will recommend alternatives to any friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, or strangers that are willing to listen. Not am I no longer your customer, but for being price gouged like this, I will work hard to take other customers from you, as well. Price Gouging | 44999313|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|934
3 | Good, but... It worked great until I got to the healthcare area. I use catastrophic insurance that I got through the marketplace.

For example, I have a rental property and I looked for about 5 minutes going through every menu until I finally found it. Also, last year I got 10% on my Amazon gift card and this year they're only giving a paltry 5%. I used the 10% gift to pay for Turbotax last year. I tried to contact them about this and they conned me into a callback and 12 hours later..no callback. Also early in the season, they used my bank info from past year to automatically charge me for the 2015 Turbotax download. Every time I deal with Intuit, I get more and more disappointed.

My return keeps getting rejected and I get a message that says that TurboTax will help me fix my return but there is absolutely no help and it does not tell you what the problem is so that you know where to go to fix it. I'm very frustrated and will now have to file an extension. What should have been a three hour adventure has turned into three days of frustration. I can not efile my return even though I paid for the service. | 44999105|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|957
1 | TurboTax gets worse every year TurboTax gets worse every year and this year is no exception. I have been using TurboTax and MacInTax since the '80s and it used to be an incredible program. I don't know what the developer are doing, but it looks like they're trying hard to add more and more useless junk.

Case in point: the interview is even more obnoxious than it used to be. Don't you realize that most people don't have everything handy instantly which means they must return to questions later? If you want to do that or make a change to something you've already done, it jumps into the middle of an interview and asks questions that are not only irrelevant but I have answered before! Do I have to answer them? Can I ignore them? If I previously finished a section and I give the wrong answer, will it wipe out what I did? It is completely unclear. Filling out forms that can't be downloaded (e.g., a 1099-B) is much more confusing in the supposedly helpful interview than as a form. Why? Every time I made a change to charitable contributions it asked, me again, if I had an ItsDeductible account. Each time I reviewed my return (making fixes) they asked me if I wanted to spend $60 for audit protection. Do they really think the answers changed in the last 15 minutes? No, it's an upsell opportunity. I already paid for the product, please stop advertising others!

And, oh yeah, this year I had to buy a much more expensive version of it in order to do my taxes. Yeah, they're going to give me $25 back, but I'll bet I'm locked into the more expensive version every year from now and they won't give me $25 back next year, when I will seriously look at switching to the competition. Worse every year | 44999082|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|958
1 | Too expensive, too outdated This year Intuit released far too many versions of TurboTax, raised the price, and made few noticeable improvements, if any. In my case, my electronic returns were rejected because of possible identity theft, though the software has no way of confirming that or redirecting one to a helpful IRS or Intuit call center. The system generates the error, which is extremely vague, and then insists the user to contact Intuit. The link provided goes nowhere. On top of this, Intuit still charges you for any electronic filing fees (which are a joke to begin with) despite the incorrectable rejection. Next year I'll be doing these by hand, TurboTax is by no means any faster. Customer service is non-existent | 44999074|1|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|959

3 | Pretty easy but can be confusing at times! Ehen doing this year's taxes, just realized that Turbo taxes was calculating taxes on prior year tax refund of $1,505 when I only received $221. I cough it and fixed it manually, but if I was not looking in details, I would have to pay a bigger amount to NY state.

I WILL MOST CERTAINLY NOT BE USING THIS WEBSITE NEXT YEAR. 39.99 THAT I DIDNT SIGN UP FOR | 44999026|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|964
3 | Customer-oriented but deceptively pricey I am dissatisfied with how TurboTax would not allow me to continue doing my federal taxes without upgrading to TurboTax Deluxe which cost me an additional $44.99. I did not see any way to decline the upgrade which really upset me.
I would not mind a reimbursement since I did not need features of the Deluxe product. Forced me to upgrade my TurboTax product and had to pay $45 more. | 44999025|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|965
2 | Going backwards I have been using TurboTax and MacinTax before that since 1991. Unfortunately, the features of the software keep disappearing, and it gets harder to use every year. Creating multiple versions that increase the cost is a mistake. Making it difficult to track back through numbers is also a mistake. The ability to go into forms, and double click on a number and find the source of the number made it a fantastic way to make sure you were doing your taxes right and understood how they were being done. Now it is just a black box that you must trust with no understanding of where the numbers are coming from. features keep disapearing | 44999023|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|966
1 | Didn't Tell Us About "Extra" Fees Turbo Tax was not clear and charged me $80 at the very end for 'audit protection' despite their own admission that my audit risk was low. Until they charge you ridiculous fees at the end | 44999020|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|967

2 | Disapointed but satisfied Tax season is frustrating to begin with, continually being tricked into getting the Turbo Tax PLUS edition is even worse. I can understand asking a couple times but when I say no I mean no. I had to back track twice because when I got to the final payment page I was apparently buying it. Turbo Tax is great for doing your taxes error free. But don't select paying with your refund, its an automatic PLUS signup. Unless you want it of course.  | 44999002|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|969

1 | Annoying Upsells I went to annualize my income to reduce my underpayment penalty. The form didn't have instructions for grabbing last years total tax liability, and I had to google it in another window. Then it didn't fill all the fields in correctly on form 2210AI, and threw an error during the review time, and I had to go fix the forms manually.

:(

Kept trying to sell me state returns, even though I live in a state with no income tax.
Kept trying to sell me "Audit Defender" - No Thank You! Form 2210 Data Entry was not as good as the rest of the program | 44998975|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|972
2 | Outmoded Contact Systems Could not upgrade my turbo tax because my email address was no longer accessible. You did not provide option to send me a text message. Only recourse was to call your overloaded systems the next day.

Customer Service agent got me set with new use ID and password and corrected my email address in your system

Issue # 2: I go thru this EVERY year. Need to use credit card to pay to file state taxes. You go round and round and don't accept my card. After I get co-opted to go to your marketing site and after about 10 attempts you finally accept my credit card payment so I can file my state e-return and finish. 30 seconds till finish line always takes 30 minutes.

2 | Bye Bye Turbo Tax Turbo Tax seems to be getting more confusing. We had our first IRS audit and can't get access to what we actually entered on the tax form or get to the questions to see how we answered them. I also printed a copy of the form after I submitted it and when I checked for the audit, it was different. Now they make it much more difficult to get to chat or real time help. Plus prices are going up. All good valid reasons to just take them to an accountant and spend a little more, but worry a lot less knowing they are right. This is the last year we will be using them, very disappointing... The areas where I needed additional information, there wasn't any. No preview before purchase on state return. | 44998961|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|974

3 | 2014 Tax Surprise I have used Turbo Tax for years and found it to be efficient and generally technically sound. I was surprised this year when my copy of the basic version wouldn't allow me to open investment forms to record stock sales. I felt like this was a bait and switch as I had to upgrade my version for another $30+. I will definitely look at the competition next year before I subject myself to another Intuit shakedown.  | 44998928|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|977
3 | near disaster averted I have been using Turbo Tax for 13 years. Our tax situations have changed, but I've always been very pleased. This year, however, was nearly a complete disaster solely because of the state download disaster. After completing the federal return, the system would not allow access to the "free" state download I'd already requested, that it said I had. After requiring me to purchase the state, the same issue occurred. I was at a standstill. Not even the main website allowed me to download what it said I'd purchased. So while I was partially at fault for trying to download the software onto a thumb drive (bad idea), the main website had issues. When I finally spoke to a customer service representative, he re-sent me the state download, and walked me through an alternate method of installation. It was the kind, understanding, knowledgeable customer service representative that pulled through in the end. This was by far the most frustrating year, and almost turned me away from Turbo Tax for good. My state download disaster was averted, and finishing the filing was simple, after that. Looks like I will continue using Turbo Tax...on my hard drive/desktop. state download a nightmare | 44998923|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|978

Bad customer service, cannot get a real person on the phone! Turbo Tax, or intuit should hire more personnel, especially on the 15th if they expect return customers next year!

1 | BEING PUSHY WITH COLLEGE STUDENT have used turbo tax for years for all family members taxes. when doing my college students taxes today I was asked to upgrade to turbo tax plus. when ideclined this service it said I would have to start from beginning and enter info again, even though the address info was already there from previous years. was asked a second time later on.
the total income was 1010.00 and the refund was going to be 121.00.
Trying to get an extra 30.00 out of us is shameful of you! and they making us put in info that you already had just makes me angrier!

1 | Online Products and Pricing I started my taxes by selecting a simple, single online product and got whacked additional charges at the end. When I selected start over it and went through process again I got the same product charges I originally did not want. Going back to accountant next year, not worth hassle and frustration. My simple taxes through Turbo Tax cost me 179.00 - what a joke. Impossible to go back and select lower $ products | 44998830|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|986
1 | Removing Ex-Husband's Email frm Acct = Impossible While there is a lot to be said for the easy interface and 1,2,3 done of TurboTax, I have to say I have officially fallen OUT of love after having my ex-husband receive password re-set prompts from the system even after TWO calls to customer service asking them to REMOVE his email/username from my account.

Likewise, when my ex tried to do his own return, I received an email that a password reset was attempted.

I mean REALLY, TurboTax? This is just awful.

Next year I will hire an accountant instead of going through this again.

When I entered these points into a search bar on the TurboTax's site, they said they were "aware of the problem and to contact them after April 16". I fully expect to get a refund of $59.99. ASAP.

3 | Lots and Lots of Fees I had a hard time figuring out how to handle my back door conversion to my Roth. Google helped me figure out how to do it through Turbo Tax.

Immensely frustrated at all of the hidden fees. We bought the software for $50 or $60, had to pay extra for some more complex tax scenarios, had to pay extra to file my state return, and had to pay an outrageous "convenience" fee to pay my taxes with a credit card. Absolutely ridiculous in this day and age. I paid it all this year, but probably won't do it again. I could've dropped everything off with the tax man for what I paid to do it myself. Low cost at first, until you want to do somethng complex, pay your taxes or file a state return | 44998817|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|990
1 | A TOTAL RIP OFF!!!! I file e-filed my Federal return in March, but waited to file my state until 4/15/15 (My fault). However, when I was paying to file my state return, they required me to pay $95, instead of $40. They had me, and I had to pay because I had to get it filed...TOTAL RIP OFF!!!

3 | I am switching next year I have used TurboTax for at least a decade or more.
My returns have been fairly easy. The sales of complicated stocks used to be the hardest item to enter.
Then we started an S Corp.
I used to remember clicking on Help from any section of the step by step or forms menu and being taken to information relating to that issue.
Now, I have to enter the information in myself and wonder if I have done so correctly
I am currently using a CPA firm to do my business taxes and am taking their returns and entering it into TurboTax for my personal returns.
This is the last year!
It was way too complicated, and I needed more help and support than I could find for my situation on TurboTax or through the TurboTax community.
I will be paying a CPA to do both next year.
Thanks for all the good years! Didn't find the support I needed this year | 44998779|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|995

I couldn't get the updater software to work properly, even after uninstalling and reinstalling TT twice. Finally discovered the manual update page on TT website, which lets you download the latest updates manually.

Once I got the updates installed, I was able to complete my return.

Finally, several times the software took me back over pages that I had already filled out. This is a drawback I've seen in previous's year's TT. Updater module wouldn't work at all | 44998777|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|997

1 | The Community Properties instructions suck. I used Turbo Tax for years but this year version just sucked. I first tried it on Windows 8 and it didn't do the updates. So I did the updates online and I could get access to the screen to enter my 403b for credit and Community Properties. I went back to my old laptop that uses Windows 7 and I was able to install the updates just find. Again when I went to Community Properties problems. I had to flag Community Properties to be able to go back to it. The Community Properties was confusing because my husband had a few 1099R and SSA 1099. I called the IRS, Turbo Tax and went to see Two different Tax ladies and everyone was confused about the Community Properties. My husband owed and paid and after I added his income my positive became a negative. So technical if your partner pays his dues so will you with the Community Properties stuff. Here's the thing if you pay a Tax lady that don't fill anything out in the Community Properties so that's crazy. I hope Turbo Tax work out the bugs for next year. Not enough information on the Community Properties If your partner owes it may be cheaper to get it done from a Tax men | 44998757|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|999

3 | Great, except payment experience I was infuriated by this year's experience in paying for using TurboTax. I used my credit card, which I knew to have a zero balance, and was denied use of that card, the stated reason being that my credit balance was exceeded. I knew that was not true, but I tried several more times over a period of three days, during which my balance was maintained at zero, but I was still unable to get approval from Intuit. My father also tried to use his credit cards, but was also denied, even though there's no question that his cards are in good standing, and, since he always maintains a zero balance, it was not possible for him to have approached his credit limit. I was forced to use the take-it-from-my-refund option, and that needlessly cost me $35.00. I have thoroughly appreciated the TurboTax option for doing my taxes, but, because I feel as though I've been compelled to pay Intuit an extra $35, needlessly, I will have to rethink my approach during next year's tax season. I really am disappointed! extreme payment difficulties! | 44998685|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1005

3 | Easier this year than before - but felt cheated! I thought I was paying only $59 - but that was for the federal only version, not the state, and was arm-twisted into the audit defense option since otherwise I'd have to pay $40 for credit card OR deduct from federal return option; at least with the audit defense it was $5 more AND the deduction and e-filing were free. I didn't go back and deduct the EXTRA COSTS for tax preparation - it was $89 more than I thought it would be! Felt CHEATED by TURBO TAX and its approach was shady. Did NOT tell me the cost of the different options until the very end - I felt like I'd been had !!! | 44998677|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1007

2 | Turbo Tax 2014 I have been using Turbo Tax for many years and I have always loved the product. This year was an exception. It was by far the worst that I have seen... crashes, non-intuitive sections, being told that there was an error and unable to fix, etc.

Frankly you are giving your possible competition an edge. As an avid Intuit user I was surprised. Crashed often | 44998674|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1009
2 |  The option for extra items should set automatically. I unchecked the extra $29.99 charge for online access.

1 | Deeply disappointed this year! I've used Turbo Tax for 10 years now and this year was the first time I was disappointed with the program. I couldn't access the updates and couldn't proceed with with filing because of this. Shame on me for waiting til the last minute to file, but I never expected any problems from what has been an extremely pleasant program to use. I'll have to decide if next year is the time to try another company's product couldn't upload updates. Required help from Geek squad to do. Then had to re-enter all data info. | 44998635|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1013
2 | Rip off!!!! I am a college student and first time filer. I earned $1,500 and Turbo Tax charged me $45 to do my taxes. I feel like I have been robbed.

1 | Sharks This will be my last time using Turbotax.
I have used this service for years and didn't realize I could get basic filing for FREE until a dear friend of mine told me.
As an American tax payer, we have the right for free, basic tax filings. I am single, college educated women with zero kids attempting to fill the boot straps that was handed to me back in 1986.
Your layout makes that utterly impossible.
You have to be a secret agent to be able to make sure your filing stays free. I understand TurboTax is business but the hidden fees and sneaky attacks to get you to spend more, this company should be ashamed.
We all know tax season is stressful and anxiety filled- your company even acknowledges that- you also take full advantage of such. Its disgusting, I understood the 29.99 state filing fee then out of no where towards the end, there was an added turbotaxPlus fee. I dont even understand how I got there. And clearly that is the TurboxTax purpose. Surely $30 isnt a big deal but it is to a minimum wage worker in NYC. $30 is one week Metrocard pass. Shame on this company. Stop the tricks.

You won't be getting a single cent from me next year.

2 | a lengthy process to an expensive end.....REally! If the tax prep was REALLY FREE- as advertised- it would have been a great site. It was easy to use, but I FELT USED as it kept adding new charges and it should have gotten to the SEND about 35 pages sooner than it did.....but wait! just one more reason to charge you something more. And MORE!
I felt it was a rip off. But I am so overwhelmed at doing my taxes at the last minute, I Just wanted them DONE.
When they have you by the balls, your hearts and mind will follow. Felt like a bait and switch as everything I entered came up with higher charges! | 44998599|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1017
1 | Got suckered into paying almost 200 I paid more for doing my taxes through Turbo Tax then I did my accountant in years past. I thought this was a money saving option but ended up getting railroaded into having to buy the premium package. There also no mention of the 40 to file the state and then the additional 40 to file them at the same time. Really disappointed in Turbo Tax. Railroaded into paying for something I don't think I needed. Scummy way of doing it. | 44998592|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1018

2 | Disappointed I have been using turbo tax for years and have never had any issues. I have always trusted this site to file my taxes and have recommended turbo tax to several friends and family members. However, I will now take my business somewhere else from now on if I continue to pay these outrageous fees. I have never been charged almost $100 to prepare and file state and federal taxes. You can imagine my disappointment when the fee not only went up to $75 (which was the quote when I started my tax preparation) but when I finally did file, I was charged an extra $20 plus dollars. I hope you do not continue to take advantage or I will no longer use your product and will warn all those I highly recommended this site to in the future.

Please lower your fees for those of us who are returning customers...we should be valued and not robbed. Charge far too much money this year for use | 44998582|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1020

3 | not so user-friendly this year I'm not sure if it's the new Home & Business version I had to buy this year, but I don't remember being this annoyed the past few years. To go in and add a single business expense, you have to navigate through 20 screens. Every. single. time. that my husband found a new receipt. The estimated taxes vs. modified W-4s was very confusing too--I had to reread this part 4 times. Also, there should be an autosave feature, at least in the more expensive versions. Windows decided to update itself with TurboTax open on my screen and I had to reconstruct a lot of work. So this year TurboTax made me buy a more expensive version, charged 25% more to efile my state return, and drove me insane with the navigation paths. cumbersome to navigate to parts you want to update | 44998569|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1025
3 | grammer and spelling errors I found the interview nerve racking. I tried to chat with an agent or talk buy never could. I realize it is the worst day of the worst season to contact you but you are also aware of the demand.

I feel that is some areas my return may be audited because I am starting a business this year and the print out stated I end use of my business this year and there was no way to correct it.

The were more than an embarrassing amount of spelling and grammar errors on the interview. NOT what I would expect from a fortune 500 company.

I selected the small business return and was forced to go through the interview about farms.

Other than that I continue to use turbo tax or local help until a flat tax get passed in congress for everyone making less than $50,000.

2 |  I began 15 years ago with TurboTax boxed edition when i first bought my house; it seemed great, asked questions and had little videos with info to help.

The on-line version every year has made the anger in me immediate and intense, as it does something wrong EVERY single year! Such as NOT asking ?s in order as you go thru the guided portion. I was finished with ALL entries and it showed that I OWED hundreds of dollars for federal! SOMEthing was wrong! I finally found the spot (not easy! feel very sorry for 1st time users!!) comparison to last year's whole list, and saw that the morggage taxes portion was blank!!! WHAT the WHAT?!! IT NEVER ASKED ME THAT!!!! I had to continuallllyyyyyyy go back to find bits and pieces that were MISSED by TurboTax!!!!! I had to MANUALLY find them and answer!! UGH!!!

Then, I was finished, but the 'check' found that I was missing medical expenses... I answered the ? that I didn't have any this year, because every year there has not been enough $$ spent to bother (even tho I did add it last year and prior). I could NOT get that worksheet off no matter how many times I tried, revisited, re-answered the medical ?s!!!! UGH!!! I finally just put in one answer (I also feared that if I put in ONE answer, it would then come back and ask twenty more, like it always does!!).

HOW MANY items were MISSED???! Several years ago it reduced my lowly return from over $900 to $600!! I couldn't figure out what happened!!! It's STUPID!!! EVERY year it does SOMEthingS wrong, forgets to ASK questions (in order or at all!), adds info where NONE was inputed! | 44998504|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1031

2 | did not like this years version I have been using Turbotax for over a decade. This year was the first time I did not find the assistance needed.
Did not get any assistance on how to interprete certain fields in state return. There was also a broken link to the sc state website for forms and publications.

Help online does not seem to cover state specifics.

I became disabled in 2014 and have SSDI and a LTD income ,
I would like these topics to be covered better in next years version, or at least be able to find assistance on specific fields.

It would be nice to see instructions from worksheets so you at least know what you are entering.

Example: Permanent Disability exception : you need to enter an amount, but I had no clue what amount I should be entering, The max of the distribution taken, sure its not medical expenses, as that is another exception. so not sure what needed to be entered here. If you were disabled for the entire year, does that mean you always enter your total distribution, to not have the 10% penalty ?

I also got some ammendments that IRS made, and I believe these amendments could have been easily caught in the Turbotax software. Now, I had to spend time to fix and communicate with IRS, even had to hire a Tax Lawyer, to know how to handle this, as it was clearly a glitch in the TURBOTAX software. no help on certain fields. would like to be able to get more help | 44998462|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1034

2 | Definitely not happy with this version I've been a Turbo tax user for about 8 years and I've always enjoyed the self guides to hep me finished my taxes. Both W2 and 1099 work.

This year I got the deluxe version as I thought it would be sufficient to submit a Schedule C but it required me to upgrade to the next version up. Fine, another $40, total cost for the software now $109. In the part where I got stopped and it required me to be upgrade to the next version, it has a statement that read, "You will continue exactly where you left off." That was not the case. I was entering my business expenses when it stopped me and after the upgrade, it took me to a whole new set of screens. Then it was prompting me for all sorts of different questions that made me feel like my taxes were going to have errors in it.

I decided to start over which I did not want but it is better than having the IRS knocking at your door. When I started over, I had expected to have the self guides walk me through my 1099, but instead I had to click on every single thing I wanted to work on. This really took me by surprised and it was extremely disappointing. All of sudden I have a less than deluxe version of what's supposed to be their Business class software.

Really upsetting and frustrating. Next year I'll be looking to move to another platform for my taxes. This is the first time Turbo tax has let me down in a big way. This version is so bad that I never want to buy Turbo tax again. Deluxe version didn't have enough info to complete my business | 44998424|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1038

3 | Fairly painless Turbo Tax can guide you through entering your data and it knows what to prompt you for. However, often times tax terms aren't really explained fully. Also, when I was prompted to enter the hour for e-filing, I had to guess that the Turbo Tax program meant the hour that is the best time for the IRS to contact us, as there was no explanation other than "form blah needs the hour". Great. But what I do like is their program that lets pros handle the situation when you get audited - and we usually get audited. It's nice to know that all I have to do is upload needed info to a secure server, and someone else is going to handle the IRS for me. People unfamiliar with tax terms may get confused, prompts incomplete | 44998348|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1047
1 | Never will use Turbo Tax again Not only do you now have to pay for state income tax returns if you want to use a credit card the fee is an outrageous high 2.49% of the amount of your payment. I understand that credit card companies charge a fee but that fee is now caped and all you are doing is using this as a huge income generating device. I will never use Turbo Tax again and I will tell everyone that I speak to not to use Turbo Tax as it is no longer a good business to deal with.

2 | Expensive I have used Turbo Tax for several years now. I was disappointed that the cost went up mid tax season. Seems like they could have waited until between tax years.

1 | Will never use service again I had to file a simple tax return: single, no kids, no house, no car, one job, one state of residency. I thought TurboTax would be the perfect option over accountants and service providers wanting to charge me $100 to do my taxes since I've done my taxes by hand before this.

In the end, TurboTax swindled me the same and for inferior services. Basically, almost no tax return can be filed under their "free" version -- if you have to file a 1040, then you must use the "deluxe" version. However, this is only told after you have spent a few hours entering all your information and you are left with the decision of restarting from scratch or just paying the money.

My own fault for waiting until the last minute to do my taxes so props to TurboTax for seizing the opportunity and getting my $100 but it won't happen again. Deceptive pricing. | 44998314|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1052

2) I had no changes in my situation from last year, where I used the "Deluxe" version. However, this year, TurboTax Deluxe "forced" me to upgrade first to "Premier" then to "Home & Business" versions based on my situation, even though I did not need added "advice", just what I had filed with TurboTax Deluxe for 2013! Aggravating!
3) During the final reviews, several errors had to be corrected, but the information provided by TurboTax was insufficient to guide me to what needed to be corrected, why there was an error at all, and what my options were to correct the error. I had to make several guesses at what to correct, try again, guess again, and try again, several times before sufficient corrections were made to allow me to finish my return and e-file. required me to upgrade my Mac OS; forced TurboTax upgrades on me; difficulty finding errors | 44998277|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|1057
1 | scammed with the turbo plus Filing was very quick and easy...however, I chose the turbo free edition and chose to insert all of my info on my own. When getting through to the end and selecting a payment method for my state taxes I chose to subtract from my federal.. Then while reading the sunrise bank agreement form saw where I was being charged the 29.99 for state taxes and the 29.99 for turbo plus---I am guessing this was decided when I chose to deduct from my federal. However I did not see a check yes for plus anywhere. So after realizing that I went back to select payment method and chose use my credit card. Well after putting in my credit card info and clicking submit it then shows I was STILL charged 59.98. This really frustrated me! I chose to put all of my info in because I did not mind doing it myself and I wanted to save the other 29.99. Not right at all! paid more money and still did the work | 44998271|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1058
1 | Sneaky fees The "free" online edition ended up costing me $60. The big problem is that I am not sure how it became $60. I agreed to pay $30 for efiling the state return but then somehow I got upgraded to Turbo Tax plus I think. If I was not doing this at the very last minute for my 80 year old mother-in-law I would have punted on this.

I have been a loyal, paying Turbo tax customer for years. I am getting tired of the constant sneaky, ever increasing fees and all the sales pitches (especially in a product I have already paid for). I think I will try a different tax program next year. Sneaky fees. | 44998270|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1059
2 | No Option to NOT file City Taxes 1. Bring back Turbo Tax Basic -- NOT COOL not offering it this

2. Don't jam your customers into using the deluxe version after they enter their HSA information. VERY NOT COOL.

3. Most importantly, FIX the software to allow users to opt out of filing city taxes!!!!!! This was the second year in a row where I had not choice in this matter.

3 | Extra fees Turbo tax was great besides the hidden fee they snuck in at the end. It was 29.99 to e-file. Well they charged me an extra 29.99 for selecting turbo tax plus ( which I idnt do). Every time I tried to remove it, there would only be $$ signs and no amounts when I went through the list of charges. Not ok!!!! The extra $29.99 hidden fee that I tried to get rid of and couldnt. | 44998234|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1061
2 | Ok for Late Filing Turbo Taxes is extremely easy to navigate. But, as someone who works primarily on contracts (1099-MISC), I wasn't able to receive nearly as many write off's from TurboTax as I was when I worked with a CPA last year. It's possible that if I had purchased the home edition, for nearly twice the starting price, I would have found what I was looking for. But, I'm not sure. Didn't provide the deductions I received when I had a CPA prepare my taxes | 44998232|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1062
1 | This is a rip-off I thought that I was getting the free return and was giving my credit card to pay my amount due to the IRS and instead I was paying the $29..99 Turbo tax fee.

2 | Complex Taxes are Beyond What Consumers Can Handle Several of the instructions seemed to assume prior knowledge of processes of which we knew nothing about.

After following all of the instructions for each section as best we could, the software "found" 21 errors, many of which we could not fix without completely filling out whole sections again, but with different values which would have been inaccurate.

I will no longer use TurboTax. I will hire a professional form now on. I don't trust TurboTax any more. Following the straight forward instructions created errors. | 44998206|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1065
1 | Have used for years now it's a "Bait and Switch" Not worth the cost when it keeps making you upgrade for each form extra.

I am on SS disability. My only income.
Was under the impression that I would be using the free version of TurboTax, but because I had one misc 1099 you charged me
$94.98.
Because I submitted 1 misc 1099. Ridiculous !!!

2 | I have always loved Turbo Tax I have always loved using Turbo Tax in the past but since I purchased a Windows 8.2 PC, Turbo Tax has gone down hill in my eyes. Turbo Tax should have stated why their system does not work properly on Win8.2. They should have investigated and found what is needed by the user and state what needs to be downloaded to correct the problem that is happening to the Win8.2 community. Not to just say that the user needs to download all updates to their system. This shows that Turbo Tax does not value their customers like they used to. Probably the last time I will use Turbo Tax to prepare my taxes. TurboTax cannot be used with Windows 8.2 apparently. | 44998172|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1071
1 | Wasted hours of my personal time Twice I had to purchase Home and Business because of software glitches. Spent several hours on the phone with TurboTax Technical Support (which were wonderful) to get the state portion of my taxes to download correctly (one time it didn't and they had to issue me a free use of the online version, which for the same price as the CD is a one time use hence the purchase a second time only to experience the same problem. 10 hours of wasted nonproductive personal time because of software problems | 44998168|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1072
1 | Caught off guard - in a bad way... I re-entered all of my tax info from last year (free version). Then, towards the end it forced me to upgrade to deluxe ($55!) because I had a 1099-Misc form. I disclosed that I had this form at the beginning! Couldn't you have upgraded me then so I didn't have to re-enter everything?! The software waited until after I had committed a significant amount of time to tell me. Very disappointing and it ended up costing me half of my tax refund. Needless to say, I am very upset and will not likely be selecting turbo tax to file my return next year. I have heard good things about tax slayer though...
Other than that, I think the Turbo Tax is great and this is like my 4th year using it in a row! - I just feel like I was mislead is all. Hidden Agenda | 44998165|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1073

you advertise discounts, but during checkout using online system, you charge $39 for state. this is rip off because I could down load the program and run locally, but this was not understood until very end. Extremely misleading. If I had another product, I would try their's before yours.

3 | Lots of bugs. Support was good. Taxes mostly good. Bugs:
* Wouldn't allow me to print or save. Eventually crashed. (Fortunately I found a recoverable temp file.) Turns out this was because I had an expired email associated with my Intuit account. (Impactful despite having bought an offline download copy.) Took an hour on the phone with support to resolve. Support was very helpful, professional, and friendly, but blocking me from saving was not an appropriate software response.

* Wouldn't give me the option to elect the Amazon bonus despite having purchased off TurboTax.com and meeting all the requirements. (Didn't reject me, just didn't offer it.) Lost opportunity cost of $460. Tried reinstalling per support pages. No luck.

Confusing K1:
* Spent nearly 4 hours trying to map the information on my K1s to the TurboTax questionnaire. Lots of software bugs. Entering a K1 was very confusing. | 44998015|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1086
3 | A Few Good Glitches The product kept prompting for review of the 1098 but without a way to fix it.

3 | Better than doing it by hand? Overall, it was a more pleasant experience than picking up the basic forms and filling them out by hand. The software asks a series of questions lifted directly from the tax forms that are given.

I have three major complaints:
1. The software, during its "Final Steps" stage, asked me to find out how to "avoid insurance penalties in the future", despite the fact that I've been insured all year long (and my return reflected this). The redirect took me to what I sincerely HOPE is an internal site, that asked for some personal information and at the end told me there was nothing more to do. This is just plain bad practice.

2. There was a field that was missing from one of my W2 forms, and there was no description of said field provided when TurboTax demanded I provide the box.

3. Although we paid for a boxed version instead of using the free federal edition, we were still obligated to pay for our state tax return. We would not purchase in the future if we must buy the state taxes separately anyway. Although not strictly deceptive on their part, it is counter-intuitive and a more clear labelling pointing out that state is not included with the basic Home edition would help. Deceptive "Final Steps" portion, didn't label some of the fields | 44998008|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1088

2 | No many choices I did Business and Home.

Everything went ok until the "REVIEW" part.

This is when things got bad. The program will tells you that something is wrong, but it will not help you with the solution...

Ex:
What is MACRS, or ACRS? ?????

What is the Depreciation Type? ??.... how should I know, the program is supposed to help you decide what is the best choice.

It also ask me for the length of the depreciation.... ??? one more time, how should I know.

And the the top of the pie.......

FORM 2106 Adj Wks Line 51 Depreciation Percentage??

Really? are you asking me what is the Depreciation Percentage on something that I have no clue. That is the reason I bought this program on the first place.

Final Review needs to have a solution to the actual issue, maybe even take you to the actual part of the program where the issue is caused. The other 10%. The rest of the information, guessing for the best. | 44998001|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1090
2 | Direct Deposit Fee I have been using turbo tax for several years now. I am disappointed at the fee amount for direct deposit. I fully understand the filing fees, but the direct deposit fee? For that reason alone, I will not likely use Turbo-Tax again, and perhaps will discourage anyone else from using it. the cost of having the refund direct deposited. | 44997989|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1091

2 | Multiple add on costs They promote "Free tax filing" but to no surprise it ended up costing just under $90.00. I used turbo tax last year. To retrieve needed info from last years filing required paying their basic service. I have an HSA account through my employer. This one simple item that involves answering roughly 10 questions required I now pay for their deluxe service. Then when I am ready to send in the e-file, they tell you there is yet an additional second party bank fee which then brought the cost up to just under $90.00. If they were up front with these add on's I would be OK with it, but as it is I will go with some other service next year. Started as "FREE" but multiple add on cost | 44997959|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1095

3 | Rediculously low refund I like that you have some of my info already in the system when I do my taxes. And it's easy to file. But so time consuming. Don't like that I had to pay 29.99 for filing my state with my federal and then you take it out of my federal refund! Doesn't make any sense. Would be nice if it didn't cost so much too. Having to pay 29.99 for state! | 44997932|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1098
2 | DISAPPOINTED AFTER MANY YEARS USING TURBO TAX THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS EXCELLENT. IT HAS THREE MAJOR FLAWS.
1. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO SEE A BOX THAT SAYS "SORRY IT IS TAKING MORE THAN A MOMENT" WHEN IT IS TAKING MANY MINUTES TO ACTUALLY LOAD!
2. THERE ARE FLAWS IN THE SYSTEM IN THAT IT TOLD ME I COULD NOT FILE STATE TAX ELECTRONICALLY AND THEN ALMOST HAD ME PAYING $29.99 TO PAY A FEE TO FILE THE STATE TAX ELECTRONICALLY. THIS WAS VERY CONFUSING!
3. A CHARGE OF 2.4+% TO USE A CREDIT CARD IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!! IF THIS IS REALLY A CHARGE FROM YOUR CREDIT CARD PROVIDER YOU NEED TO FIND A NEW CREDIT CARD PROVIDER. I HAD TO USE IT THIS YEAR BECAUSE I WAS LATE FILING BUT IN THE FUTURE I WILL NEVER USE A CREDIT CARD AGAIN AND PAY THIS EXORBITANT FEE.
I HAVE USED TURBO TAX FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO MANY PEOPLE BUT WHILE I WILL CONTINUE USING TURBO TAX MYSELF I CANNOT IN ALL FAIRNESS RECOMMEND IT ANY LONGER. TAKES WAY, WAY TOO LONG TO INITIALIZE TURBO TAX PROGRAM AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER CONFUSED HOW TO PAY | 44997916|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1099
2 | not happy with a few things I was EXTREMELY frustrated to spend 2 hours totaling my medical expenses only to find they didn't matter when we took the standard deduction instead. The prompts/form should be more specific as to perhaps first inform what the standard deduction is so that people will be dissuaded from going through the work of totaling deductions if they already know they won't meet a certain amount.
The second thing that I'm not happy about is that at the VERY end I was told I HAD to upgrade to complete the process. No specification as to WHY I needed to upgrade. After I agreed to upgrade, I was only asked one further question, and it was whether or not we had had health insurance all year. Since this is the LAW now, it seems that it should be part of the standard filing process. ALSO, we had already answered many questions about health insurance that should have already answered the last one. If it was required to upgrade for THAT question alone, was ANYONE able to file for free? I would have not been so frustrated had the reasons for my need to upgrade been laid out specifically. I have to assume there was some other reason, or you intentionally led people to believe they could file for free when they couldn't. In taking the standard deduction, and having fairly standard answers to the questions, I do'nt know why we needed to upgrade. You need to make that clearer in the process. For $60 I could have paid a real person to do my taxes and saved myself hours. Thanks, a lot of wasted time | 44997903|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|1100

2 | Ridiculous... I just paid $136 to get my taxes finished. Seriously? This hurts the middle/lower class when you charge 54.99 for federal, and 39.99 for each state. This needs to be changed to a lower rate or next year and every other year I will go somewhere else no matter how easy to use, $136 is way too much.

1 | Difficulty Increase Never , in the many years that I use this program this year has been the most challenging.

2 |  You start out by selecting the free filing option and then the program prompts you to upgrade to make sure you can all of your deductions. It is not until the end when you are told there is a fee to charge you having the fees deducted from your account. Why do you have to pay a fee for getting other fees deducted. That takes away from any additional money the programs saves you, it all goes to fees. Fees | 44997876|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1105

3 | Penny Pinching There should be no limit to how many forms I can file. Even if it's just the free version, but I understand that this website is run as a business. I should be able to run through a program (would love to file electronically through the IRS directly) and file my taxes inputing whatever forms I have, deductions, expenses, etc. Having to "upgrade (or fail to file properly)" is really nasty. For me it just kept stepping up the need for more "help" that did almost nothing for me at all.

The biggest help was getting to talk with an actual tax professional for an hour. He was insightful, towards taxes not TurboTax's business decisions about upgrading users unnecessarily, and not at all rushed or curt. Wish I could remember his name. Bless that guy!!!

Just to file a normal return with federal and state, and a TINY home business (which used to be covered by "Deluxe") was about $150. That's a lot of money. I could have gone to HR Block, and maybe I will next time. Some of the questions that came up during "review" were NEVER asked/covered during the input. Also, it's hard to access forms, and several times it told me I had errors but I couldn't access the forms to simply correct them.

Yet, I have a Chase Liquid account and cant make a direct deposit as I do not have checks, and currently(4/15/15 9:06pm) my bank is not open so I cannot call for a routing number. Their website is also down. Kind of conveinient for Intuit since I couldn't go back and redo the section that charged me more money. Thanks!

IF you choose to "start from scratch" and provide all your information all over and not use the saved information from the previous tax year, users were supposed to bypass this free. Instead I wasted my time by 'starting from scratch' because I was STILL billed the 39.99. For some of you reading this review, you're probably thinking it's just "39.99", but for a college student receiving a $60 return and a $20 return makes a difference. That extra $40 could have been used for groceries or even utilities for my apartment. I am disappointed in TurboTax, last year it worked perfectly, and I was not tacked with extra fees. I even called the support number, but have no received a call back, but I am almost positive TurboTax will not refund my 39.99 back to my account. I will post an update, IF I am reimbursed 39.99 for the premium fee which I DID NOT utilize.  | 44997667|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1126
1 | Confused in California California is not accepting e-filing this year apparently... Tried to charge me $24.99 and then rather than simply tell me the option is not available they tell me my credit card is no good...
Not good... Wasted a lot of my time... Offering an e-file option in California | 44997666|1|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1127
1 |  Had to re-do my return on-line b/c I used up the five chances to e-file per my desktop. I had to pay an additional $120 to file and then e-file my return. The cost is excessive and after twelve (12) years of using Turbo Tax, I will make a switch next year.... Two THUMBS down... | 44997660|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1128
2 | confusing and dumbed down from prior years I can't believe how you tried to simplify things and ended up giving not enough info. The biggest issue I had was that you took the form box away so there was no way to see the actual form for a certain point of input. I have a masters in taxation and I was really disappointed with how the software worked this year. dumbed down software; have to get super complicated version to do simple things | 44997659|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1129

2 | e-file was terrible I have used TurboTax for 8 years to do my taxes and have enjoyed using it every year as it was very user friendly. This year everything went smooth and was working good until it needed to be submitted. It was not clear on what was needed for a PIN or AGI number. This needs to be easier or I will not use this product again in the future. the efile continued to fail and was not a simple solution to gte it worked out. | 44997645|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1131
2 | Changed Versions?? For the last 8 years we have used Turbo Tax Deluxe Version. I have a home-based sales business and Deluxe always covered what we needed.
This year we bought Deluxe version and tried to enter tax info for home-based business and a screen popped up stating I need the Home & Business Addition. And that I can buy it now for only $40! I just paid $59.99 and now you want another $40 because you didn't let people know you changed the software. If I would have known this ahead of time, I could have purchased the Home & Business addition for the same price as the Deluxe at the store!

2 |  Im very dissatisfied that I chose the free edition and I was still charged 29.99 to file my federal and 29.99 to file my state, I agreed to teh state, I only got back 37 from state so you got all of that besides $6. I feel that if I choose no thanks I don't want to upgrade than don't upgrade it at th end and then when I try to go back through it won't let me change anything.  | 44997620|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1133

1 | Obummer care tax I will not be using turbo tax again because of theObama care tax penalty. Turbo Tax did not read the part of the UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW that the penalty is only collected through refunds!!!! I could not transmit my Federal return without paying the penalty or using a installment plan. The IRS can only collect the fine thru REFUNDS ONLY!!!!!! This is what happens when communist Democrats are in control.  | 44997612|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1135
3 | Quick, but full of bugs TurboTax made filing my taxes quicker than it has been before. I did run into trouble on both my state and federal returns with going back and making changes to entries.

3 | Not as good as previous versions for knowledgable I preferred the old version, before it was streamlined. It let me get into the nitty gritty, which I liked. I always have to worry about my investments and now I have a house, too, and I wanted details, not to be babysat 100%. I'm sure there's a happy middle available, but they swung too far for me.

1 | WTF It is kinda nice to have something like this. It is very confusing though. The ? buttons only add to the confusion. When I did the estimate it claimed I would get back $1300. When I did the actual tax forms I owed $150. I entered the same info that the estimate had me enter. Why was it $1400 less? Very confusing | 44997551|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1140
1 | Horrible Product- never using again Will never be using TurboTax again. The company handicapped the program and constantly wants you to upgrade it to get more features. Its nothing but a running sales pitch for a product that should give you everything you need to file a return without a constant barrage of different versions and upgrades.

This is a prime example of how not to market a product and how not to retain your customers. Bye Intuit.... Too many upgrade gimmicks | 44997535|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1141
3 | Good features, bait and switch I have used turbo tax to file for years. I selected the free option, as normal. Instead of the regular $50 processing fee, I was charged $104. Never told which product charged that high, never given an option to select a different product. Would have been fine paying if the pricing was upfront. Now I just feel duped.

2 | DOB You tell me i have been rejected because my birthdate isn't correct. I was born on 10/16/1930 and that HAS NOT changed. I am now 84 years old. This is CORRECT and ALWAYS has been. I have filed my taxes for several years with Turbo Tax. Now, this year, the only way to get past information carried forward is to pay you for it. We have little to no income and for many years, since retirement, only gotten back $60 from the state of CA. So we did EZ, therefore not having to pay the $40+ dollars, and for some reason the DOB isn't correct. This is very frustrating and concerning for a man of my age. You tell me my birthdate isn't correct. | 44997516|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1143
1 | Sucked a** Screw this option, never filing with turbo tax again!! It's not free at all, it was $30, plus $30 for state, then at the very end there was an additional $40 upgrade I didn't request, and TurboTax wouldn't file my return without that upgrade/service fee. Complete waste of money! I'd rather sit down with a CPA to do my taxes... at least I know whatever he/she charges will be going back into my community and not to some internet company with hidden fees! pis*ed away $100 | 44997507|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1144
3 | Lost my deductions Not only did I lose the list of deductions that I entered directly, but my 2013 file was also lost. All I had left was my pdf. All the data had to be entered all over again. No prior year history could be retrieved. I have used Turbo Tax for years and this is the first time my data was wiped from my laptop. I was on the phone for a while with a Turbo Tax expert and they could not find my data anywhere. This was the first time I entered data directly into It's Deductible without printing it out or writing it down, and this was the time my data was lost. I further discovered I was not the only one. No one else found their data either. Very disappointing, and leaves me trusting the program less. All the data I entered was lost before I actually filed | 44997472|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1145

3 | Overly complicated Very frustrating. This could have taken less than half of the time, if it weren't for all the attempted product sales, and having to constantly re-enter information that had already been taken care of -- sometimes on the page immediately previous. Very, very annoying, that.
Filing fee was ridiculously high.
I did not appreciate - at all - being bombarded with "offers" to spend more money on tax products I neither needed nor wanted. Doesn't remember LOTS of info already covered | 44997404|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1148

1 | Hidden fees First, it was free. Then I had a 1099 and that required upgrading to deluxe= $55. Then I had to pay another $40 because I had moved to a different state the last two months of 2014. Fine. I'll pay that. So now at $99, I went to pay. It went from the screen saying I would be paying $99, to the screen where I entered in my credit card. Turns out there was another $40 fee that wasn't listed or mentioned. The price of using the site kept increasing. | 44997393|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1150
3 | Pop Up Fees I do not appreciate, nor do I know how to remove the fee that is charged at the final filing step. This is a fee that is not outlined or offered, it is falsely labeled as a "free" perk and then you are hit with a 39.99 fee. Pop Up Fees | 44997379|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1151
1 | Overview I had a hard time finding out my PIN from last year, so when I did, I got everything finalized and submitted it. I recieved an e-mail that it was rejected. So I went back in to re-submit it, and was rejected yet again. Tried a third time and recieved a text messgae on my cell that it was accepted. So now I go back on the site to see if I can submit my state taxes and it now says my federal was rejected yet again.Doubt if I use this site ever again YOU DON"T KNOW IF IT WAS TRANSMITTED | 44997360|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1152
3 | Another year, another return, another headache The main flaw with this program is the boneheaded exclusion of MacOSX 10.6 Snow Leopard compatibility. Just for yuks, I prepared my 2014 taxes with a competing product, and - after repartitioning & installing Mountain Lion - with TurboTax Premier 2014. Needless to say, creating a single-purpose partition with a different OS version than my daily production environment is a hassle.

In some ways TTP2014 _is_ superior to the competitor. For example, the Easy Step Interview is significantly more-thorough.

But there is one flaw with TTP2014 that was maddening. After properly entering Form 1099-B short-term sales, which passed muster with the Federal Review, the same data was improperly transferred to the State Return Schedule D/E. I got several "Excess characters on line 7" errors that were INCREDIBLY difficult to correct. Maybe my state's return was wonky, maybe _all_ states are. Don't know.

The first two times I was not able to reach a Customer Service Representative. I was finally able to reach them using the call-back feature, which was not offered during the previous attempts. In addition, the program offered me a free upgrade to Home and Business, but again, it would not allow me to pay for it, or get it for free, even though offered.

2 | Not working! Frustrating to file a return when the system doesn't process correctly. I tried to pay the Intuit filing fees and it kept saying they couldn't validate my credit card. But when looking on my online banking app, it says that it processed a debit 4 times! Worst thing was that it would not let me get to the next step in the process. I finally had to call support and wait 45 min to get someone who gave me an access code to get through that screen and finish my efile. Now I have to wait and find out if they took my money from my bank account multiple times or did it correctly. Not a feel good feeling if there is no resolution to my bank debits. I feel like they have my money $144.98 x 4 = almost $600!!! Payment method did not work and charged my bank multiple times | 44997228|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1162

2 | Triple dipping The service is what is to be expected: your taxes are filed and you pay a small fee, which I am more than ok with. It's not optimal but I'm obliged by the polish on the site. Now what I dislike is the double dipping they do with the 'audit protection' and the visa that charges a fee every time it's used and a fee every month- both of which it hides on a separate window. Now if everyone one in the US was smart enough to read said window it wouldn't be a problem, but seeing how it's the easiest repayment option people will almost definitely choose it. Using this 'computerized fine print' is, to me, borderline predatory. The money gouging and hiding of fees or pushing ridiculous tacked on services | 44997197|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1164
1 | "free" Its like a minefield. They prey on our lack of tax knowledge and rip money out of our wallet at every opportunity. Go to a professional.

1 | Very Disappointed I have utilized Turbo Tax Deluxe for many years and have been extremely pleased with the ease of the program, but this year was a mess. This years offerings were very fractured and confusing and I had no idea if I should continue to use Turbo Tax but I have had success every year so I gave it a try.
What a mistake!
How sad that something so productive and helpful has become a questionable product.

1 | Deluxe version is a ripoff It's like a recent insurance commercial - "Are you paying for this (a lot) when you only need this (a little)?" As I started to pay, I realized I didn't need or want TurboTax Deluxe, which was the default version they started me on. I had an EZ form, so I instead wanted to use the more cost-efficient standard TurboTax. But since I couldn't easily get out of the payment loop, I wound up paying $100 I probably didn't need to.

I won't deny that I should have been paying closer attention, but I think a more reputable business would have included at least one prompt (especially with TT's "chatty" prompts) to say, "Hey, your return looks pretty simple. Maybe you don't need to use this Deluxe version."

I've used TT for the past 4 or 5 years. Because of this, however, I will not be using TurboTax ever again. Once I had paid, they wouldn't let me change to more cost-efficient version. | 44997016|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1181

1 | $$$$ Turbo Tax Purchase price is just the start I purchased the Deluxe tax program for $48 thru Amazon and found I had to upgrade to Premier, I was charged an additional $30 for the upgrade. Had I purchased Premier first it would have only been $54 not $78. I read somewhere an upgrade to premier was free due to changes. Hmmmm I think not. Then when it came time to file my state taxes I am charged another $25 for filing. I thought it was included in my purchase price. I think I will check out other tax programs next year. Intuit is just not making me happy. Turbo tax requires additional money that is not mentioned in the product review. | 44997004|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1183
2 | Like it less and less every year Over the years turbotax has become less user friendly, much more difficult to go through, much too expense, ridculously so in fact.

3 | Whoa! Lots of changes this year.... Retired with income from wages, stocks and retirement accounts - love the interview and loading of forms from brokerages. Tax piece was as easy as I've come to expect from TTax.

This year the process for planning estimate payment for this year felt different and frankly, poor. I could go into specifics and change it to get it right, but got done without an interview process on what's going to be different next year. Big space for improvement.... Planning felt less intuitive | 44996956|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1186

2 | Efficient, but not satisfied with import of data I purchased TurboTax (for the 3rd year) for the year-over-year consistency with the user interface. This year - for whatever reason - I had to type in my W2 and inputs from my investment accounts despite having imported the same information from my 2013 return. In addition, there was an "upgrade" required to deal with basic investment income from the "Deductions & Homeowner" edition. For TurboTax - let's be realistic about the product segmentation - find me a homeowner without basic HSA and investment income. Did not import W2 correctly | 44996951|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|1188
1 | Good Luck with the Special Pricing Like ease of turbotax, but wasted a lot of time trying to get the reduced pricing offered by my bank that would have saved me nearly 20%. Payment page leads you to believe that the price shown may not be the price you'll pay. Click the payment button and surprise, you've paid the full price. Impossible to get reduced filing cost | 44996935|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1189

1 | Gouging us with stupid fees Where do you get off charging me so much for deducting from my refund? I understand the fees for helping me do my taxes, but a charge for ALLOWING you to be paid from my refund? What are you--carrying my money on your back and it's so heavy, you need to charge me labor? No, you're gouging me with exorbitant prices at the end of my process because you know I'm exhausted from answering all the Q' s and scrounging around to find the papers that provide the data. Next year, I'm paying by credit card. You are smiling road robbers. #Refund my fee & I'll stop bad-mouthing you to others.# you don't deserve to charge me for deducting from my refund | 44996918|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1191
3 | too expensive and hidden charges SUCK The search feature should be improved to better locate an item already entered. The $35 to take fees out of my refund is OUTRAGEOUS and just trashy. Classless. I expect that type of lowballing backstabbing from discount tax prep software, but since I'm going to get that poor service from TT, I might as well use discount software next year for MUCH lower rates. TT Was not exceptionally easy to use or provided such extraordinary directions that I feel I should stick with this site. I have used H&R in the bast and they are cheaper, but I plan to go discount next year (TaxACT or similar) trying to find info within an area such as credits, business expenses, etc. | 44996913|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|1192

1 | It sucks The price increase is completely self-serving. And now at the deadline to file, the program produces run script errors and will not accept payment for state filing. This prevents the federal form from being filed as well. Guess I will meet many of your customers in prison. Increasede price and give script run errors when trying to pay | 44996892|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1194
1 | WTF After telling me my credit card is no good, I called your number which said your office was closed... Went to my bank today to check on my card. It is perfectly fine... Now I call you again and you put me on hold alternately with a flawed voice recognition AI. When it finally was going to let me talk to someone, you said you would 'call me back'... 'ONCE'... If I miss your call, I'm to call back?!?
WTF? $123.99? For not being able to file?
They call and the call is dropped... Starting over... After three hours you want to bill me another $24.99 to e-file in California and then tell me my credit card is no good | 44996887|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1195
3 | Meh Rejected my credit card and multiple other people I know. They put holds on your account each time you try, so be aware of this before you click it multiple times like I did. It says they can't verify, but yet have no problem holding the funds in your account. Payment | 44996884|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1196
1 | Screwed us over - do not use EVER We only needed to file 1040EZ but it upgraded us without our approval and would not even let us cancel it. I've used TurboTax for years and have never had a problem before but I will NEVER use them again! Screwed us over with fees didn't want or need | 44996883|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1197

3 | Super Easy So I loved how easy the app is to use. Only part I didn't like was that I was shown that I would only have to pay $29.99 for federal and state tax. They ended up charging me $59.99 and added on the plus version. I didn't know how to change that and I also waited until the last minute to file my taxes so I just paid it. I will probably not use turbo tax next year because of it. over charged me | 44996863|1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1199
